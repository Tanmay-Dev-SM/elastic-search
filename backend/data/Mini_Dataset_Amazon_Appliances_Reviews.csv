EOU// Both temperature and humidity are accurate to about +/- 2% maximum, checked against digital meters in a controlled environment.  The mounting will determine whether you get a true reading.  First, there must be adequate air circulation behind it, which requires more standoff than direct-to-wall as supplied (hence 4, not 5 stars); I made two 1"" deep wood block spacers for the screws, and still see some variability.  Second, a wall that absorbs and holds heat, like concrete block, will radiate heat and may add a few degrees late in the day.  Similarly, a cold cement board, metal or vinyl wall may subtract a few degrees early in the day.  Third, hot air rises so if it is mounted near a ceiling, it may read a few degrees high and the humidity may be affected.  Mounted directly to a wall, readings may be wildly untrue.  The humidity bar reads from 40 to 90%; above or below that has little additional effect on wind chill or THI.  The color coded index rings are pretty much useless for a visual reading from a distance; there is simply not enough color differentiation, but the information is there in printed numbers.",3,"Useful, Not  Perfect",1382054400,"10 18, 2013"

The seal between the motor and the disposer went band and the thing was leaking water from the motor all over everything under our sink. I wanted another Insink Erator so I could easily swap them out without having to do a complete install. This unit fit the bill perfectly. I wasn't near a box store and instead of buying the Ace Brand knock off I did next day shipping on this. With Prime it was an extra $8. The price here and the extra shipping still had me at about half what our local plumper wanted for this unit and a bit cheaper then the box stores. I was nervous about dropping to 1/2hp after having 3/4 but for normal household use I think you're just fine with this. We haven't noticed much difference.Remember to knock out the plug for the dishwasher drain if you will be using that.Also don't waste your money on a wiring kit or plug for this unit.

A1PY6SJT8UHL92,B00004U9JO,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","When we moved into our new house the food waste disposer was dead, so I had to purchase a new one. I can't even recall why I chose this one, but I did. This was, I think, in 2002.I have never done any plumbing work in my life and I am not particularly good at home repairs/maintenance, but I could install this unit without too much trouble, although it probably took me at least one hour. But believe me, if I can do it, it cannot be that hard.PROS:- The unit still works after about 8 years, so it can't be too bad!- It jammed for the first time a few days ago, and at first I thought I had to buy a new unit (which is why I started looking for reviews of comparable products on Amazon and why I am writing this review myself only now). Then I found out that the unit comes with a wrench which can be used to rotate the motor to unjam it. It took me about 5 seconds and now it's working like before.- We did not have any leaks so far.CONS:- Noisy. We do not use it too much, so we do not care too much, but it certainly is loud.- Not that powerful. We have to be very careful with what we put in, especially now after several years. We have trouble if stuff like tomato skins, shrimp or egg shells end up inside. Really we are reaching the point when we can only use it for... soupy stuff.- Given that a lot of stuff is not properly shredded, sometimes there is bad smell coming from the unit and I finding myself more and more often fishing for residues inside, which is a bit gross.Overall, I can't say that I have been too happy with this unit, but I also can't agree with reviewers that are finding this a piece of junk. I am sure it's not the best you can buy out there, but it's also not so expensive and surely you could do worse. But if I had to purchase a new one today (and maybe I will) I would certainly choose something different.

The wrench provided to detach the previous Badger won't survive the torque needed.MAKE SURE YOU GET PLUMBERS PUTTY.  I assumed the unit came with what I needed,  I am stoopid. It doesn't.MAKE SURE YOU GET PENETRATING OIL: If you are replacing a worn out unit, there'll be rust that formed on the attaching flange on the el cheapo steel used.  Spray all the way around the attachment mechanism and then go to lunch or Lowes to buy a large hammer.  Give it an hour for the oil to do it's deed.  Then go at it with hammer and wrench.  I found an extra person was needed with a crowbar to provide counter pressure on the Sink side of the flange.  That finally allowed the two of us manly men to separate the old unit from the sink side of the attachment mechanism.Epilogue: This review was for a unit I bought for my daughter's home. My own disposal finally died. In researching a new one, I found Waste King has actually designed a totally better mechanism for hanging the unit. That's the company that gets my dollars. As expected the dead Insinkerator had rusted shut and the joke of a tool bent without doing the job. Lots of grunting, whacking and two Aleve later, the Insinkerator was in the trash bin.

The leaks start small and then the cracks run, as they will do anytime there is vibration.  Since the leaks were on the back side, they weren't noticed until the leakage became apparent on the bottom of the sink cabinet.  After I removed it and inspected the cracks, it looks like it has been leaking for a few years.  Not what I expected after light residential usage.  I took pictures and sent a note to Insinkerator customer service even though it was past warranty since I noticed so many people reporting the same type of cracked housing failure.On the one hand, they denied ever knowing of a problem and quoted several customers stating that their units lasted 10 or more years.

I don't think it burned out as much as it probably just got completely gummed up. Anyway, lately it often took the allen wrench to get it unstuck so it would run. After doing that a number of times, it was time to break down and get a new one.There is another make of disposers sold here on Amazon (Waste King) that have better reviews than the ISE Badgers do. I was ready to buy one of those when I read one review for the lowest end model that said there was no allen wrench fitting like ISE uses and to get it unstuck, the manufacturer suggested using a broom handle. I went and downloaded the owner's manual from that manufacturer's website and using a broom handle to unstick the disposer is STANDARD PROCEDURE across their entire line of consumer grade disposers. Needless to say, I am NOT sticking a broom handle down my sink, so I bought this one instead.After 18 years, emptying out the cabinet below the sink and uninstalling my old one was the bigger PITA of this project.

Water would not leak out when the sink was running and disposal off, but when the disposal was turned on water blasted out in a high pressure stream.  Rather than replace it, I waited until evening (done with kitchen sink for the day) cleaned the housing near the crack, lightly sanded it, and patched it with JB Weld.  The sink was used the following day but the disposal was not run until the repair had about 24 hours to cure, and all was well.  A few years later the housing cracked again, in a different place.  I patched it as I did before and the disposal lives on.This is a good disposal for the price, but the housing is obviously a weak link.  Where it seems to crack is at the fine vertical lines where I assume the mold is parted.  If yours cracks I suggest you make the easy repair as I did.  Another thing to consider is that if your Badger 5 has died completely, the latch/connection to the drain fitting does not seem to have changed over the years, and neither has the height of the discharge.  That makes replacing it with another Badger 5 relatively quick and easy.",3,"The housing will crack, but you can fix it.",1328572800,"02 7, 2012"

Got it installed in under an hour - just left the sink mount from the old Badger in place and this new one fit right on, very simple.  It does take some arm strength to hold the incinerator up while you try to get the three flaps to fit into the mount.  The rubber seal is a little in the way when you are trying to do this, but it is not hard, just a matter of trying a few times until all three flaps are secure, then twist and boom!  It's on.I did turn off the wiring from the breaker box.  Connecting the wires was very simple - just follow the instructions in the manual.  They were very clear.  Insinkerator does not provide wire caps, which I had but which would have been very frustrating had I not had them.  Imagine having to drive all the way back to your hardware store for a .15 cent item!!The plumbing pipe provided did not connect with my existing plumbing piping (all up to date) so I am confused about that. It ""works"" but is basically resting inside my old pipe, so I need to figure that out. I do not know why their pipe is not threaded to receive a flange cover.

Baby - Bag your boyfriend if he can't install this. Chances are he's incompetent. Get a new boyfriend with hair on his arms OR you do it! An honest 1/2 hour, minimal tools and it's a done deed. Ease of installation and price are the reasons to buy this Badger 5.Warning - This disposer does not include the power cord. Those of us with an outlet inside of the sink cabinet can either reuse the cord from the unit you're replacing or cut the end off a cheap #14 or heavier, 3 prong extension cord and wire that in.No doubt about it, after reading previous reviews you should consider spending just a little extra dough and go for another brand. That being said, the Amazon price can't be matched at any home improvement store. Buy this disposer here and now and don't waste your time chasing around in your car trying to find the better deal.I went to that store that rhymes with Blows and layed out wayyyy too much dough. I was in a rush to get 'er done. The up-graded brands there were ridiculously expensive. I don't give a rats pitooty how quiet they are. If you're sticking it under a sink, in a place where the sun don't shine, why on earth would you spend over $100 - $125 on a waste disposer? Maybe if you live in a place like Aspen, then you NEED to spend that money.Longevity. Don't bank on it lasting until you're grey and long in the tooth. (No offense intended to those who are already grey and long in the tooth.) My previous Badger hung in there for 7 or 8 years. Do you really think it'll last for forever?

I decided to expend more effort than economics would favor to see if I could get this thing in serviceable order, see my photos and answer to someone's question for the details. In a nutshell, the failure was due to corrosion. The failure results in nasty water leaking literally through the electric motor (probably creating an electrical hazard) which creates a nasty mess under your sink and could result in damage to your cabinets, flooring, and anything else that happens to be below there. I was unsuccessful in my repair attempt (given another one, I could probably pull it off) but I learned a couple things about the construction of these disposers.We do not use this thing heavily. I suspect that if we were more agressive users of the disposal, we would have done damage to the plastic housing as other reviews complain about.I replaced mine with a badger 1 (because I am in a rental unit) if I owned the place, I would get something with all-stainless steel internals, or just not have a disposer.

Like other reviewers have posted, the upper housing (the ""grind chamber"")on these units is made of plastic and is thus prone to cracking and leakage. These are also NOISIER!! than many other brand units. My recommendation is to either go ahead and spend the money on one of the better designed and quieter ""InSinkErator"" models or choose another brand entirely. I decided this last go around to get a Waste King ""Legend 9940"" (Time will tell on that brand, but it gets good consumer reviews). The waste King is much quieter, and it was way easier to install, as it comes pre-wired with a plugged cord, and the Badger requires either installation of a plugged cord (not included) or that a power line/wire be hard wired directly to the unit.The singular thing I do like about a Badger is that if the unit gets jammed, the owner can un-jam the problem by turning the motor by using a hex key/ Allen wrench (supplied with the unit) at the bottom.Bottom line here is that there are better designed units out there for the money spent, in my opinion.",1,Perfect choice for anyone who enjoys replacing disposals,1328313600,"02 4, 2012"

Because Badger 5s are cheap and they are everywhere.  Now, after one year, one year I tell you!, the housing on the new one is cracking and the thing sprays water all underneath in the cabinet.

The rep I talked with wanted to make sure I knew there were millions of disposers and rarely do they have issues, typically when they do its because someone dropped a fork or knife or something not disposable into the chamber and it risks damaging the blades, motor or casing which is probably what happened to mine.InSinkErator told me even though the warranty couldn't be verified they wanted the broken unit back to analyze it and see what/why the housing cracked, in turn they would ship me a replacement unit if I could install it myself. I accepted and it shipped last friday, then Monday my replacement was delivered. Removing the old disposer was as easy as sticking a screw driver in the lock collar and turning it a 1/4 of a turn and the disposer came right off. I put the new one on, wired up the electrical and in less then 15 minutes was done. I'm shipping the bad disposer back to InSinkErator so they can further improve their products at their request.For it possibly being 6 years old, I can't fault the disposer for failing, and with no proof of purchase InSinkErator didn't have to step up but they did in the name of customer service and product improvement. I know this is a review page for the Badger 5, but I wanted to make sure I stressed how well the support was for the Badger 5 I had, the ease of replacement and use of it.I can now change my initial review of ""stay away"" to ""recommended"" because this really is one of the cheaper disposers on the market, and they have customer service to back it up. Often you buy the lower end model the service lacks a bit, in this case it shined and my new disposer is working perfectly.",5,"First one broke, InSinkErator customer support rocks!",1357603200,"01 8, 2013"

I did notice on the inside that the center plate was rusting away and missing chunks, but ultimately it was an accidental plastic bag that broke the unit although I think it was going to break down shortly anyway.Since I was just swapping the units I didn't buy the wiring kit - you might want to buy it as that was my biggest problem - my B1 unit had a plastic insertion that held the wire in place and it is not really designed to ever come out once pushed in - I had to take a hammer and screwdriver and pound the metal all around the platic to loosen it enough to pull it out.  Then the wires were crimped so you will have to cut them and then re-splice the ends to use for the new unit.Without the wiring would have been 30min to remove and replace.  With the wiring issues took me over an hour and I didn't even have to mess with the top/sink part and replacing the flange,gasket, mounting ring,etc as I just kept what was already in place.

This is my second one gone bad.  I have a couple of rental units and it sucks when a disposal fails out the bottom of the casing or the bolt on the bottom.  Tenants do not always notice or call immediately leading to further damage of cabinetry.

A34UVV757IKPVB,B00004U9JO,justsomeguy,"[2, 3]","* Original Review *:I've had mine for about 5 years now, which is fine.  It's worked OK.  It's pretty darn loud, and I've had to clean the drain pipes out once because this thing doesn't do a super job grinding up stuff.  The Badger 5 is your basic garbage disposal model.  It's the weakest thing out there.  Also the loudest.  If you are moving out, and want to put in cheap appliances so the new owners will think everything is new and shiny, this is what you're buying.  If you just moved into a place and see this under the sink, the previous owners installed the least expensive one they could find for you.  Sure, mine worked for years without any issues, but it did eventually develop an internal leak I could not repair and it has to be completely replaced.  Garbage disposals are themsevles disposable.  If they break, you get a new one. I'm going to be upgrading to a more powerful disposal of another brand (3/4 to 1 hp is recommended by my plumber) and this time I'll have my eye on a more quiet model as well.---------------* UPDATE *In all my years of dealing with innumerable companies and products, I am blown away by the excellent customer service provided by InSinkErator!  I wrote this original review because my old Badger died, and my plumber (who I've used forever) didn't have anything good to say about the Badger 5.  I was upset because I couldn't fix the leaky disposal myself (I'm fairly handy), and my plumber told me I had to get a new one and that these things aren't ""fixed"", just replaced.  I wasn't expecting anything writing the original review, but Jackie from InSinkErator read what I wrote and reached out to me directly.  We spoke a couple times and I am amazed that company actually took the time to read what I wrote and helped to resolve the situation!  I learned my diposal was 8 years old (!) - (it was installed before I moved into my place (been there 5 years), but I was told it was ""new"" at that time.).  In short, this company easily deserves 5 stars across the board for doing what they did in my case.  I'm an InSinkErator customer for LIFE now.

White ""Book lover to the max""","[15, 16]","We moved here in 1994 and I, while remodeling the kitchen, decided to replace the 23 year old GE Disposall with an InSinkErator. That was the first one. In 1998 that one stopped grinding - ran but really only swirled the garbage - barely. New one - and that one ran until the innards rusted out in 2005. Replaced it with the slightly more expensive stainless version. Last night, 27 June '08, the motor started to overheat(smelled the hot insulation), made some loud growls and when shut off, instantly stopped. It still works but barely. My guess is that a motor bearing (sleeve?) is failing. Now I have to buy a new one - but what do I buy? We seldom grind anything more difficult then veggie peels, with an (very) occasional chicken bone. My history with these, at least the lower end versions is that they are junk.

A167HMYNHQK9VV,B00004U9JO,Luv My Amazon Prime,"[3, 3]",Back in October 2002 our builder put a Badger 5 disposer in our new home. Today as I write this review my husband is replacing the Badger 5 for the third time. Three Badger 5 garbage disposals in less than ten years tells the story. Each disposer lasts just long enough to outlive it's warranty. After purchasing this third Badger 5 I stopped to read the Amazon reviews. I now wish I had read the reviews before buying this third disposer. It appears we are not alone in the housing cracking complaint. Let me warn all current Badger 5 homeowners that this time the disposer crack leaked enough water as to totally destroy the sink cabinet floor and sides of the cabinet. We had standing water over an inch deep when the leak was discovered. Now we have a major kitchen cabinet mess to fix not just replacing a dead garbage disposal. Would I recommend a Badger 5? Not knowing what I know today. If you purchase a Badger 5 expect to be replacing it every three years. Next time we switch to a different brand disposal even if that means calling in a plumber to install it.Let me also add that I found a product called Sink & Vanity Protector (Google it because sadly Amazon doesn't carry anything like this product). It is made to fit under the sink and protects your cabinet floor from water leak damage. I wish I had found this product BEFORE our leak. If you own a Badger 5 disposer you need this protection and I encourage you to buy one to prevent a mess like ours. Best tip is just don't buy this brand.UPDATE 1/7/2014 and this Badger is dead. Grinding up a lemon and it died today. Obviously this company's products aren't worth wasting your money.,1,Another cracked housing complaint.

It replaced our older SinkErator Badger that we had used for maybe 20 years, and in two homes. I brought it with us when we moved from our previous location, since I had purchased it and installed it in that place as well.If you want to plug it into a wall socket under the sink, which must already exist -- as it did for us, then you have to either remove the electrical cord from the unit you are replacing, or purchase the packet that is available separately. I just removed it from our old disposal and installed it to our new one.We don't abuse our disposers, which means we don't pour grease down the drains, or hard objects like bones, silverware, olive pits, peach pits, etc. We dump those kinds of things in the garbage. So we take care of our disposers. So far this is working like a charm, we have not had any issues with &#34;cracks&#34; as we have read in other reviews, and the unit runs fairly quietly. It runs far more quietly than I expected.Installation was not difficult. It took me about an hour, but that was partly because of the strange sink configuration we have in our home. The instructions were extremely clear and does not necessarily assume that you know what you are doing. I found them helpful, even though I pretty much knew what I was doing from the get-go. So no problems with installation. Be sure you have plumbers putty on hand or purchase a small container of it. You don't need much, but it obviously does not come with the unit.After much research and even looking at disposals in a couple stores, we felt the InSinkErator Badger 5 was the best product for the money, especially through Amazon.

Since, I do not want another Badger product I just ordered a Waist King and considered the Badger 5 a total loss. Also, another plumbing charge, I will have to pay.This is the problem of ordering on line. You can't return it to the store and buy a better unit.

I chose another Badger 5 because I figured it would fit perfectly and last a similarly long life.  I can't comment yet on the life span because I just installed it, but the ""fit perfectly"" thing was ""right on"".  I removed the old unit, took off the power cord, and put the power cord on the new one, and it went in perfectly.  I did not replace the old sink ring / clamp, because it was not rusted or worn, and the new unit fit just fine.  It is not easy to lift, push up and hold the unit in place evenly for all three lock points while tightening the rotary clamp, but I managed to get it on there, using the box it came in to prop it up all but the last inch or so.  Took about 45 minutes overall to remove & replace, read instructions, gather tools, and clean up.  I did not buy from Amazon, so paid more at Lowes, but I didn't want to have the kitchen sink ""down"" in the event of missing parts or broken pieces, etc.  I wanted a nearby source of reliable help in case I got into a jamb.  No worries, it went smoothly.  I suspect some of the complaints of cracked plastic housing and resulting leaks are caused by over-tighening the drain line bolts.  Or by shipping impacts.  No need to have the incredible hulk turn that wrench - just make it reasonably snug, and you've got it.  I gave it 4 stars out of 5, because I don't yet know about the lifespan; the Insinkerator is made by Emerson Electric, and I trust all their stuff - good company.  Noisy?  Sure, a little, it's a grinder - what else would you expect?  No matter how much insulation they put around the motor, the noise is still going to come up out of the sink drain.  And really, how long should it be run?  Just a few seconds.  The new one is just the same noise level as the old.  I believe the key to long life for these is to use it sparingly - don't dump a lot of waste / crap down the sink, it can't be good for your pipes, sewers, etc.  Eat the food, throw away leftover meat, bones, coffee grounds, etc, do not expect a $100 item to grind up all your trash and still last a lifetime - ain't going to happen with any brand.",4,Bagder 5 - replaced with same item,1330992000,"03 6, 2012"

A2HCKBBEXELJ3R,B00004U9JO,Pampeliska,"[3, 4]","Re-vised on 10/16/2012(It's pretty long, so you can just read the first and last three paragraphs to save yourself some time).When I wrote the original review back in April, I gave it only three stars.  Upgrading to five stars based on company's exceptional customer service and overall performance of the disposal.The brief recap of original review:  The unit was installed approx. four years ago.  Not sure exactly, as I have not kept the receipt, but it was more than 3 and less than 5 years.During that time I have used it only several times a week on an average never running too much stuff through...  it always worked perfectly and I never had any issues with it (such as cracks or leaks) other than occasional jamming of the wheels - easy fix by using the hex wrench.Then one day it just stopped, with no prior warning signs and no trick or tip I found on-line was able to revive it...  it just kept humming and not turning at all.The price of parts and labor on fixing these things usually equals or exceeds the price of new unit in the first place, so I knew I was not going to bother trying to repair it.That's when I wrote a three star review (five star for previous performance and one star for durability...  I felt that ANY product, no matter how good, should last more than just four years of a light use)...Since replacing it right away was not a priority, I just put in on back burner and lived with no garbage disposal at all for several months.  Needless to say, it was very inconvenient and quite a pain in the neck.Then I came across the first comment under my review, left by Jackie from company's Customer Service Dept.  I sent her an email and received a very professional, courteous response the next morning with a phone number to call.When I called, Jackie picked up the phone almost immediately and her demeanor throughout the whole conversation was very friendly, helpful and sweet.  Since I had no receipt, I gave her the serial number and from that she was able to determine that my unit was manufactured in May 1997, meaning it was fifteen years old.That came as quite a surprise to me, as I am completely positive we bought it new either at Lowe's or Home Depot when we were installing it...  so it must have sat on their shelves for quite some time prior to that.No wonder it lasted only four years.  And yet despite it's age, it still looked shiny and beautiful, with no rust spots or any other signs of wear and tear.  As a matter of fact, I was able to sell it on Ebay for parts for 10 dollars.Anyway, Jackie answered all my questions and concerns and offered a discount of any of the current products in the stock.I have opted for exact same model and the price quoted for that was $52 including the shipping.  Based on my prior research, most of the USED models sell for more than fifty on Ebay and new one on Amazon is currently $78.  Given the age of my unit and the fact I had no receipt, I felt that was an excellent offer and went for it.Purchased it the same day and received several days later.  Friend of mine helped to install it, and, once again, it has worked like a magic ever since (more than a week ago).  Should some problems arise, I will come back and revise the review again, but am also confident that the Customer Service Dept. of the company will be a great place to discuss any such issues.Because of the previous stellar performance of (decidedly old) previous model and most of all, because of most outstanding and exceptional company customer service, this product definitely deserves five stars.And to any of you who had issues with the disposal, I noticed Jackie left comment under all of the low star reviews - do give her a call, she is a sweetheart and will definitely work with you to come to mutually beneficial solution.And lastly, just a reminder - when you DO install the new disposer, make sure you push out the ""knock'out"" plug from the dishwasher inlet on the disposer unit.  We forgot to do it, and my dishwasher nearly flooded the kitchen, since it kept filling up, but not draining the water out.First I thought the dishwasher life span came to it's end, but brief on-line search revealed the solution.  Sure enough, when I disconnected the dishwasher hose, there was still the plastic plug in the garbage disposal, blocking the flow.Once I hammered it out (it'll fall into the disposer, so it has to be taken out), the dishwasher worked and drained the water flawlessly.",5,"Re-vised Review, Five Stars both for Performance and Customer Service",1335571200,"04 28, 2012"

Some things I wouldn't even consider putting down a disposal in the first place. After looking at all of the info I decided to come back to the InSinkErator. I decided to go with what I knew. What I knew was that the previous disposal was in place when I moved in, and it was no where near new then. Also the point of failure on the old one was one of the blades inside of the disposal. It had somehow became loose and starting making terrible noises when turned on. I bought the same model and installed it. It has been in place for almost a year now and works just like it did the first day. Some reviews complained about the blades inside rusting. I honestly thought they all did that.

A3J8A5L5AF5TX9,B00004U9JO,Richard La Barca,"[0, 0]","I have a small apartment complex where I have been using the lowest cost (1/3 HP) models for tenants. Two reasons: first, the low cost and second, because I can't always know how a tenant will (or will not) use the disposer.After using the lowest cost disposers for over 20 years now, I find the newest (currently tan housing) models have not withstood regular use for more than 5 years. The older models were of the same blue housing as this next step-up model which I am hoping for at least 5 years use. Our older (blue housing) disposers have lasted at least 5 years and some are now almost 20 years old.FYI: I don't believe ISE is using the same quality metal causing these newer models to rust out quicker but, in my recent experience, I found that people who use their disposer properly will get at least 5 years service...that is acceptable for my purposes in the apartments. I did have 2 ISE disposers that only lasted about 2 years. One was from a tenant who almost never used it and allowed it to rust extensively and corrode from non-use. Using it helps keep it clean too. The second one, I determined was not being used properly, i.e., the tenant was not running water before turning on disposer causing food debris to accumulate in the small chamber below the blades/masticator. I did have one last almost 5 years.I believe if you always run your water first, turn on disposer, then discard food waste down disposer, you will get more longevity from your disposer and less likely have drain stoppage problems. It's also a good practice to run plenty of water (maybe even cleanser) after using the disposer to rinse out the small chamber between the blades and drain pipe. I've found that some disposer stoppages are caused by this chamber being clogged which also causes it to rust and deteriorate prematurely.I'm hoping (expecting) longer use from this 1/2 HP model and rate it 4 stars for now...I will update if there are any issues that occur.

The sound isn't really an issue because the disposal is only run once or twice a day for about five to ten seconds. So spending extra money to get a quieter unit wasn't really necessary. All-in-all this is a great garbage disposal and hopefully it will last as long as my old one did.Tips: You will need to use your old power cable and install it to this disposal if you use a wall outlet to provide power to the unit. If you have your dishwasher attached to the unit like I do I would recommend using a wood drill bit to drill the plastic plug out from the side. That is what I used and the hole was perfect with no edges or burs left behind for wastes to get stuck to.

The 5XP lasted over 5 years, then developed the well-documented crack in the housing above the drain connection.  It was a very slow leak, so I opted for an Amazon online order, chose the Badger 5 based on price and availability, and the replacement arrived quickly as expected.I have no prior experience with this particular model (Badger 5), but its appearance is essentially the same as the other Badger models I had and installation was a breeze with one exception: existing plumbing was old and the PVC drain pipe cracked when I connected it to the new disposer.  Luckily I had a spare drain fitting, so installation was only temporarily delayed while I found the spare part in my garage.  Lesson learned: recognize that old PVC fittings become brittle with age and might need replacement, so plan accordingly (especially the pipe that connects directly to the disposer).  Note: ISE packaged a new PVC drain pipe along with the Badger 5, but it is an elbow fitting typically used in single sink installations.  My particular installation (double sink) uses a longer, straight pipe instead of the elbow fitting.The new Badger 5 has been working flawlessly for a week now.  I also have an island sink with a Badger 1 that has been running perfectly since 2005.4 stars -- would have been 5 if the replacement hadn't cracked like so many others have experienced, so my confidence in the Badger line has been shaken a bit.",4,Easy replacement for old Badger disposer,1365724800,"04 12, 2013"

I don't know if I got a lemon or if they're all this bad.Problem 1 - that damn split ring used to lock the neck assembly to the sink. It takes about 4 hands to install it. You have to use one to keep some stuff tight against the bottom of the sink. You need another to keep the tube thing that the split ring goes onto pulled down far enough to expose the groove the ring goes into. You need another to open the split ring and one more to actually guide the split ring into the groove. Stupid design.Problem 2 - the metal collar that connects the main body to the sink attachment pulls clean off the main body as soon as you try to tighten it. The pathetic plastic collar that's supposed to stop it coming off is not doing its job.Problem 3 - it's missing bits. There should be a collar to stabilize the wires as they exit the main housing.

I'll write another one after I live with it awhile.I am having lots of hate for the snap ring, and how it seems to require turning the entire kitchen upside down just to finish the installation. This is an exaggeration, but not by much.The unit mounts onto an assembly that forms a seal with the sink's aperture. The seal is achieved with plumber's putty or a similar mastic. The problem is, two of the installer's hands are needed to hold that part still, while two more hands to hold three parts in place underneath the sink. Then two more hands to expand the snap ring and clip it into place. The operation is somewhat delicate because the seal at the bottom of the sink can be compromised if the assembly gets jostled around too much.For what it's worth, a can (30 oz or so of crushed tomatoes or pumpkin) is the right diameter to place on the sink ring, then a board on top of that, then any dead weight greater than the force needed to put the snap ring into place (about 3x the disposal body's weight in my case.) Ymmv of course. The water drain part went right in to my existing plastic pipe trap.You have to supply your own parts to provide strain relief and/or conduit connections for the electrical connection. The part I got to fit to the dispos-all's body said '1/2"" knockout' which is a standard electrical box knockout size, here in the US at least.After installation it ran just fine on the GFCI-protected circuit available near my kitchen sink. I never take running a motor on a GFCI circuit for granted. This one worked.========Living with it. Written 23 Aug. 2012As promised, updating the review after 8 months or so of living with it.

No wonder they won't warranty it for more than a year.On the first unit, the blades just locked up -- I assumed due to the corrosion.  On the second unit, the case developed a crack in its side, and water had leaked beneath my cabinet (which went unnoticed until black mold had ruined the cabinet base).  The location of the crack doesn't appear to have been any kind of obvious stress point, so I am assuming it was created by interior rust and corrosion.I have to wonder if the more expensive models have this problem as well, or is it just on this low-end model.Advice: If you buy this model for the price, be sure to inspect it on a yearly basis for signs of its demise.",1,"Case Cracked, Blades Rusted",1240790400,"04 27, 2009"

Like lots of other folks my 2.5 year old Badger 1 failed, but rather than developing a simple crack in the housing, my unit developed cracks all around it.  On Friday 25 March, the motor unit separated from the collar and collapsed into the cabinet under my sink.The engine and grinding mechanism struck a copper tube that fed a small instant hot water heater mounted under the sink.  By a stroke of luck, I happened to have just returned from an evening out and was able to turn off the water to the heater and kill the power to the InSinkErator unit which was still plugged in.  This action limited the damage to superficial water staining and minor scratches and a dent on the cabinet base.  I will not speculate as to the amount and nature of the damage that could have been caused to my home had I not been on the premises at the time.I DO NOT recommend buying anything with the words Badger or InSinkErator on it.  As a person with design engineering experience, I can tell you that the plastics that ISE are using for these units are flawed.  They are brittle and not capable of handling the kinds of torque stresses that are applied when grinding.  Plastic pieces literally crumbled between my fingers.

A1SG5LXDO7TPY9,B00004U9JP,John Robertson,"[0, 1]","After buying 3 of these in 15 years, I've started to see a pattern (!).  My latest Badger 1 started leaking through the various screw/circuit breaker holes in the bottom.  On the previous ones owned, I had a permanent leak on one and an unclearable-jam on the other.  All of these ""cheaper"" Badger Insinkerators have galvanized steel rotators and stainless blades...what that means is, in about a month or two, when you look into the unit it will seem horribly rusted because the galvanized steel will still rust.  That's just par for the course for these models.  (Actually, I think theInSinkErator Badger 5XP 3/4 HP Household Food Waste Disposerwhich is similar to the Badger 9 at the big-box home stores, might be all stainless).  You get a 1 year warranty with the Badger 1, it's 1/3 HP, but it has no sound insulation.  In truth, none of this had ever really bothered me except for perhaps the lack of all-stainless steel components.  I live in Phoenix where the water is very hard, although I do have a water softener (salt-based), yet I'm a still a little disappointed with the 5 year life span I'm getting.  I do not use disposals much, but I pretty much want to have one installed for those occasional times or when guests arrive, who would usually expect one.This time, I think I'm going to try theInSinkErator Evolution Compact 3/4 HP Household Food Waste Disposer.  It's $169 on Amazon (same at brick and mortar stores), but it's a step up in most ways...all stainless steel internal components, sound insulation, a larger grind chamber (34.6 oz compared to 26 oz for the Badger 1), more HP, and a 4 year warranty.  If I get 10 years out of this one, it would be the same cost as two Badger 1's lasting 5 years each.So you can decide for yourself.  If you live in a softer-water area, or don't demand much from your disposal, or are a landlord, this one may be for you.  But based on my experience (and apparently, that of several other people in the reviews here), you do seem to be giving up some longer-term reliability with the less-expensive models.",3,Proportional quality to its price,1257811200,"11 10, 2009"

Kennedy ""kennedy610""","[0, 0]","I have a long history of working with kitchen disposals having several rental properties, and thanks to the very poor quality of InSinkErator.InSinkErator products are so poorly made that I replace 1-2 disposals every year or so. Why do I keep buying them? Simply because the InSinkErator ""mounting system"" is well engineered which makes motor replacement relatively easy. Other brands, and they are few and far between, are even worse in quality and replacement more complicated. I will give InSinkErator credit for the mounting system, it is very good.Read the customer reviews of all InSinkErator models and you will see a common thread, they simply do not last. I noticed on the cheap Badger 1 model which I keep replacing, that the motor typically seizes and there is rust on the blades and drain area. The rust suggests the seizing may come from rusted parts, so when I went to buy another disposal I noticed that InSinkErator makes a stainless steel model at about twice the price. I considered it for a few minutes, until I read reviews of the stainless model that owners had exactly the same issues with the stainless as the cheaper model. In fact, the reviews of all their models regardless of price and motor size from owners report the same problems, they universally suffer a premature death. I couldn't see the point in spending more money on another model knowing they all last about the same amount of time. I have stuck with the less expensive model.I would say a typical life span of a InSinkErator is about 4 years. If you get to 5 years you are on borrowed time. One of my properties needed a kitchen makeover, and I actually removed the disposal completely. Smartest thing I ever did and I will do the same for my other properties when I am between tenants and even in my own home when the disposal dies the next time around.There is an opportunity for another company to come along with a well made unit and steal the market away from InSinkErator.

The plumber's puddy is really hard, so rub it in a ball to warm it up and make it more malleable, then roll it between your hands until it's like a thicker string-like shape and apply it underneath the ring.

A3J8A5L5AF5TX9,B00004U9JP,Richard La Barca,"[1, 3]","First thing, a garbage disposer needs to be used (like a car) to keep all the parts working well. I've had over 40 years of experience with ISE disposers and, personally, I'm only on my 3rd one in all those years. I have a small apartment complex where I have been using these low cost models for tenants. Two reasons: first, the low cost and second, because I can't always know how a tenant will (or will not) use the disposer. If you always run your water first, turn on disposer, then discard food waste down disposer, you will get more longevity from your disposer and less likely have drain stoppage problems.Granted, I don't believe ISE is using the same quality metal causing these newer models to rust out quicker but, in my recent experience, I found that people who use their disposer properly will get at least 5 years service...that is acceptable for my purposes in the apartments. I did have 2 ISE disposers that only lasted about 2 years. One was from a tenant who almost never used it and allowed it to rust extensively and corrode from non-use. Using it helps keep it clean too. The second one, I determined was not being used properly, i.e., the tenant was not running water before turning on disposer causing food debris to accumulate in the small chamber below the blades/masticator. It's also a good practice to run plenty of water (maybe even cleaner) after using the disposer to rinse out this small chamber. I've found that some disposer stoppages are caused by this chamber being clogged which also causes it to rust and deteriorate prematurely.So, if you want to save money and use care, this is a good choice. You could get about 15 years of use. If you are someone (condo/homeowner) wanting one to last many, many years, I recommend an all stainless steel model. Still, without proper care, you could just be wasting a lot more money.Overall, I believe the life of a disposer is greatly determined by its use and care.",4,ISE Badger Works Well When Used...,1305417600,"05 15, 2011"

A14YW5HVTNYHT,B00004U9JP,Ron Nielsen,"[0, 1]","It works great as long as you are careful what you put in it.Basically anything that you are able to pick up or scrape needs to go into the trash.Skins of any type like onion, potatoes, watermellon, cantilope, oranges, even cooked beans and peas, or anything starchy like rice, will clog it almost instantly.  If you are VERY careful to put them down slowly with COLD water running full force you can sometimes get them down, but god forbid any ever accidently get into your dish water while you are doing dishes.  Hot water seems to make rice and potato skins swell or something and make it even worse.You should also run it every few minutes while you are cooking and before you do any dishes, because if something has fallen into it before you do your dishes, you are almost guaranteed to have full sink of dirty water that won't drain.  You should definiitely keep a plunger nearby, because most of the time you can get it to drain yourself without needing to call a plumber.If it doesn't go down with the plunger, I have found it helpful to scoop out the dirty water into the other sink.  Fill the sink again with fresh water, run the disposal while you plung until you have worked some of the debris back up out of the sink, scoop that into the other sink, and repeat until the water in the garbage disposal is clean.  Reach into the disposal and pull out any fibrous debris there might be, and repeatedly fill, run the disposal while plunging, and bail out the water.  Be patient.  Sometimes it takes several sessions, and sometimes whatever is stopping up the disposal has to decompose some before it will clear.  The longest I have ever had to work at it is three days.  By compulsively running the disposal every few minutes everytime I am in the kitchen, I have cut my clogs and dishwasher over runs to once every couple of months.Oh, and be careful of scams.

They are now discolored and warped. I do not mind the discoloration since it doesn't affect function, though it is sort of an eyesore on the stovetop. Much worse than that, they have developed a slight bulge in the middle such that none of my cookware sits flat on them--I tried both covers on both 8"" burners. For what it's worth, I used them on an inexpensive electric coil stove. Perhaps I used too high a heat? I don't remember reading in the directions that you can't use a medium-high heat.While they worked, they were great. Took a long time to heat up, but I felt much better about using my terra cotta on the stove. They look very impressive fresh out of the packaging.

With the plate, it takes a bit longer to heat up a pot, but once the pot is boiling, you can use lower heat so I believe it saves me a few pennies. I can simmer a large soup pot without scorching and the pot is easier to clean. A hamburger will not brown as well on a heat tamer. The plate does stay hot, so if I remove the pot, I have a teakettle of water on the stove to put onto the plate until it cools. I do that anyway with hot burners, since I cant trust the cats not to get stupid. I expect to use it for canning to boil down fruit. Good buyEdited 8-1-13. I had incorrectly stated the plate did not fit the large coils of my electric stove. In fact it fits well. I had to tip the rim of the plate over the coil edge and the whole thing fit into place extremely well. Duh!I have been canning this week. The tamer is awesome for making jam. I make a low sugar jam by adding the fruit as I cut it to a graniteware basin that is sold as a dishpan. This pan has curved sides and a large base, perfect for boiling down fruit. Without a tamer, I had to stand over the pot, stirring constantly for 20 minutes, lest the bottom scorch. Then, when I add just a spoon of sugar, the boil gets harder, and you can burn the product quickly even if you stir constantly. With the tamer, I keep chopping and adding to the simmering pot, giving a quick smash and stir  after each addition. When I added the sugar, no scorch. Cleanup was way easier because the pan never scorched. I even heated my hot pack tomatoes on the tamer. You want to add tomatoes to the heat as you chop them, because if you cut them all up, and then add them, the enzymes while sitting can create watery separation. It has changed my canning. So far the tomatoes are not separated.",5,So Useful On an Electric Stove,1370476800,"06 6, 2013"

So to minimize any further water damages, I have researched reviewed and then purchased this Nordic burner plate at Amazon. I couldn't be happier with this product.

A1ER23A7CRR5S5,B00004W4UJ,LTZ,"[3, 3]","This is good for:-gas cook tops-electric stove-tops of COIL designThis is NOT good for:-glass stove-tops that are completely flatRight now there are two pictures on Amazon - one of the product alone and one of the product on an electric COIL range.  Both of these pictures are top-views of the product.  We should add a bottom view of the product to give better understanding that the bottom of the product has a lip around the circumference, which elevates the middle of the product up off of a level surface by maybe 1/4"".  So if you are using it on a flat cooking surface such as glass-top, there will be a ~1/4"" gap between the glass burner and the flat portion of the Nordic disc.  The gap makes this product inefficient because air is a terrible heat conductor (it is an insulator) so heat transfer between the flat cooking surface to the Nordic disc will be inhibited by the ~1/4"" of air insulation.  The only point of contact on flat surfaces will be the lip on the circumference.IF you have gas or electric coil, get this product and you will be happy with its heat spreading capabilities.  IF you have a flat glass-top, you need to get appropriate cookware to spread the heat and not expect this product to help you accomplish that.  Appropriate cookware to spread the heat evenly on flat-top ranges (or ANY cooktop) is Cast Iron cookware, or Stainless Steel cookware ""cladded"" with aluminum.  The Stainless with aluminum-clad means that the top and bottom surface are stainless, but an interior aluminum disc helps spread the heat, as the excellent ""heat conductivity"" of aluminum means that all aluminum surfaces will be approximately uniform temperature (at least more-so than other metals / materials).  (Sorry, I know this is not a review for cookware, but thought it important.)NOW, all of that being said; I was happy with mine for the 1 year that I used it.  I used mine in the following manner: I put mine on my gas grill, which has only two burners that are circular in shape (maybe 3"" diameter, say).  I needed to eliminate hot spots on my grill, as all of the heat from the burner was traveling directly up (vertical) and not reaching the corners of the grill.  I put it directly on top of the gas burner, and my grill / cooking grate was ~5 inches above the heat tamer disc (I guess they would call this a ""Heat Plate"" or ""Heat Tent"" Replacement).  This product worked perfectly for this application for 1 year.  After 1 year, I made the mistake of putting it through the dishwasher, which stripped ALL of its paint, leaving a rusty looking metal color.I am replacing mine due to this mistake of stripping all of the paint, but I am not going with this model again.  I am going with a cast iron disc this time around, and being familiar with cast iron, I will be sure not to put it in the dishwasher ever!  I was surprised that this Nordic disc couldn't handle the dishwasher because it handles high temperatures all the time, Stainless is typically fine in the dishwasher, but something about the detergent and that paint-type must have caused an issue.  My storing the product outdoors most of the time, I am sure did not help either.",4,"Great, for the right application",1311206400,"07 21, 2011"

This is a thickish, flat-topped burner plate -with a lip around the entire bottom circumference- that you place over your stove burner to help to evenly distribute the heat and help prevent boilovers or such due to thin pots/pans and uneven cooking temperatures, although I rarely go above the ""medium"" setting on my stovetop, so I cannot speak for how this performs on ""high.""Additionally, it helps prevent discoloration/scorch marks to my pots and pans from my gas stove's flames.

I have a standard issue ""apartment stove"" (gas, not electric), which is narrower than a regular stove.  Cooking can be really fun, and even better when you have the right tools.  :)  I wanted to get some kind of diffuser for things like rice, certain soups, sauces, etc.; but I thought it also might be nice for my Lodge two-burner grill/griddle (awesome, too, by the way) to help distribute the heat more evenly.  I felt a bit apprehensive, based on some of the mixed reviews that these have gotten, but now that I've had them (2 of them, purchased at the same time) for several months, I thought it was about time to sing their praises.  These are FANTASTIC!  I got the 6-inch ones, because my stove is a little on the narrow side, and they cover the diameter of the flame perfectly, even when the flame is cranked way up.  They sit very firmly and solidly on the burner ""grills/racks"" (whatever those things are called on a gas stove).  So far, they've had a lot of use, even at higher heat (when i'm using the two-burner griddle to make roti), and I've seen no evidence of warping.  To me, they don't seem painted... they seem more like they've had some kind of a satin enamel baked onto them.  They are heavy (in a good way), retain heat nicely, tame a flame that needs taming, and have surpassed my expectations significantly.  Keep in mind: they ARE a lot cheaper than the Kuhn Rikon diffusers, and consequently, we might get what we pay for ultimately.

They are cheap enough, so I got another.Some people with or without dishwashers might think why would I need something like that for? If you don't have a non-human powered dishwasher (other than your kids), then you probably don't need one unless you are going to gift it to someone.But... for those of you who do have a dishwasher. This would be a very handy accessory for your dishwasher. Usually, before you load your dishwasher with dirty dishes, you might take the time to rinse off your dishes. And if you do them on a daily basis and they don't get disgusting and crusty with dryed on food because they have been sitting in the sink for a week, at a quick glance they may appear clean.Well, this is where this handy little gadget comes in. Whoever loads the dishwasher with dirty dishes spins the indicator so that ""Dirty"" is up. Or if you load the dishwasher and run it, then you can spin the indicator to read ""clean"". It takes the guess work out of deciding weather or not you have a dishwasher full of clean or dirty dishes.If you are like me and actually unload the dishwasher after the cleaning cycle, I usually spin it back to dirty, because as I use dishes, pots and pans, and utensils during the day, I take the time to rinse them and put them in the dishwasher as opposed to filling the sink and counter space with pots, pans and dishes.I felt like doing this little narrative as opposed to doing a one liner that simply states ""Works Great"".By the way the indicator sticks to the washer door via a suction cup on the back. Just a little water or spit and it sticks to the door for months. Occasionaly it falls to the floor. I just re-wet the suction cup and it sticks back on.I would recomment this product to anyone owning a dishwasher.",5,Excellent product for telling if your dishes are dirty or clean in the dishwasher,1299542400,"03 8, 2011"

It's very difficult to read or see - this half blends in with our granite countertops, and it would blend in with any silver or darker dishwasher too.Despite these flaws, I still give the product 3 stars because it does its job in reminding us all whether the dishes are clean or dirty.

AUE1JU8BPP8JI,B00004XSF9,lost_gecko,"[0, 0]","We've had one of these over 9 years. It has worked great for us.Further in the past, we had a square magnetic style. After a household move, we discovered that the magnetic one would not work on the dishwasher in this house, because the door and other areas  of the dishwasher front have very little steel or other metal, to which a magnet could cling. Some kind of plastic laminate I guess. Our old magnetic sign-flag-indicator thing-ee just fell on the floor.So we bought this style, because it does not depend on a magnet. I was leery at first, worrying that the suction cup would fail quickly. The suction cup on this product has clung to the dishwasher door for 9 years. The door is opened and closed daily, yet it has never fallen off.However, this may not be a good choice for SOME dishwashers:(1) if the dishwasher door does not have a smooth surface -- some type of textured or bumpy surface -- the suction cup may not cling properly.(2) if the dishwasher door is BLACK, this item will be very hard to see. The colors of this item are NOT the black and white, which you might guess from the photo. There is no white area on this; the actual colors are black and CLEAR plastic. The word ""DIRTY"" is in clear plastic surrounded by black; and the word ""CLEAN"" is black surrounded by clear plastic. When placed against a BLACK dishwasher door, the clear plastic areas will just look black, such that the entire thing will look like a big round black button.It's easy to clean around it, by holding a damp cloth flatly and sliding it behind the circle.  We do not attempt to clean underneath the suction cup part, on a routine basis.  We have not removed or detached the suction cup in years.  If I were to do so daily, I'm guessing the suction cup might degrade quicker, maybe loose its' cling.The wheel spins easily -- no strength required.  The wheel does not spin too loosely when merely opening or closing the door, but if it did, it would be no problem to reset it.This appears to be the same Interdesign product number 25500, listed as Amazon ID B00004XSF9:InterDesign 255 00 Clean & Dirty Dishwasher IndicatorWe bought ours, which is the same Interdesign brand and style, at a local store, so unable to provide opinions on the sellers here.

The two piece housing is held together, through the center,  with a single rivet. The rivet pulled apart the first time I plugged in the plug.  The internal terminals are held in the housing by a backplate, that is held by the rivet.  Once the rivet loosens, the backplate gets pushed out along with the terminals whenever the plug terminals are pushed in.  So, as is, the plug terminals could never fully seat in the receptacle terminals.  But, even if it had stayed assembled, I still couldn't have used it as is.  I purchased the &#34;Preferred Industries MQ-B50-3 1-Gang Metal Box&#34; that shows up on the item description page as being often purchased together.  I would not recommend doing so.  The receptacle is too long/deep for that box.  When attempting to mount inside the box, the receptacle housing contacts the internal &#34;Ground&#34; mounting stud.  Further, even if one turned the receptacle to an angle so that it cleared the stud, it still is too long to allow flush mounting of the receptacle plate to the box.  The raised, rear threaded port of the box protrudes to deeply into the box to allow the receptacle to flush mount.  So, I would advise not buying the two together.

They are cheaper if you buy them direct from HB (or even third pary sellers through Amazon), but by the time you pay shipping with the other sellers it's all pretty close.  The expense of the filters though is an important point to consider if you are considering to buy this type of unit.  If you need whole house humidifying all winter long it's not the right choice; if you own your home vs. renting have a whole-house humidifier installed.As for life expectancy...one can read the reviews and see that some people have a few days and some people get a few months from one filter.  This is all a function of your own water and air quality.  If you've got rusty water don't be surprised if your filter is yellow in a week, yk?Also, I've seen several reviewers saying they're trying to humidify their homes to 50%.  This is probably too high for ordinary winter use in cold weather climates.  Anything over 35% and you're going to get condensation on your windows which will freeze if it's cold.  I have a whole house humidifier (something your furnace/AC guy has to install); its maximum setting is 35% and the colder the outside temp is the lower they recommend you set your humidistat at.  Anyway, I use my HB room humidifier in the bedrooms of my kids when they have a bad chest cold.  The extra moist air helps them breath and soothes irritated airways.  But it's just for bedtime, and only when they're sick.  My unit has no problem making one bedroom as moist as I want it short term (50%); I think in a large open space it would struggle.",3,"works okay, but for a price",1198972800,"12 30, 2007"

Of course you have to keep up w/ the clean water, turn the filters over so both ends get usage in order to prolong the life, but we have found that it (filter) still grows mold and the water begins to smell after the 3-4 week period - no matter how clean the water is.  We have tried similar, cheaper filters but its the same deal.  You really need to stock up for the winter months.  If you use the system like we do in the winter, 24/7, you may want to look at other system because this can become costly for people on a budget.",3,"Humidifier is very good, filters don't last too long...",1169424000,"01 22, 2007"

But I am happy for now.Many of the problems people have complained about could have been fixed I believe by following a few guidelines:It MUST be on a level surface.  Those people who says it beeps non-stop just need to level the machine - apparently water trips a sensor under the tub.  Tilting the machine forward - WAY forward brings that water to the outlet, where it can escape.Also, do not neglect to clean the filter.

A2WVK1ZEAH2UFL,B00005O64S,Avid Eclectic,"[4, 4]","Just used my dishwasher for the first time today, and so far I absolutely love it! I gave it a real workout, too; my dirty dishes had been sitting in the sink for a LONG time. Some had been rinsed or soaked first, so I washed them on the regular cycle. The rest had food dried on them (I know, YUCK!) so they got the heavy-duty cycle. Both loads came out sparkling, even though our water pressure is only so-so. This is the first portable dishwasher I've ever tried, so I don't know how it compares to similar models, but I wish I'd bought this one a long time ago.The only problem I had was figuring out how to hook up the water inlet hose to the faucet of the kitchen sink. There was nothing in the instructions about how to do it, and it seemed as though the enclosed adapter didn't fit my older-style faucet. Went to a plumbing supply store thinking I'd have to buy an adapter for the adapter, but the nice gentleman at the counter just took the one that came with the dishwasher, popped the gasket off the top, and said ""I think it'll fit now."" (Would have been really embarassing except that the clerk at the hardware store I went to first couldn't figure it out either.) Anyway, it did indeed hook up quite easily once that top gasket was removed.It should be noted that there is only one spray arm (at the bottom), not two as I believe was stated in the product description.As an aside, I didn't have a place on the counter where the dishwasher would fit, so I put casters on a ""breakfast bar"" table instead. Even though the casters are really small (due to the size of the table legs), the table holds and rolls the fully-loaded, running dishwasher with no trouble at all. Because the drain (water outlet) hose has to span the distance from table to sink, I took a large twist-tie and fastened the outlet hose it to the inlet hose as a precaution. It did the trick and kept the outgoing water headed down the drain.The only question that remains is how this appliance will hold up over time, which seems to be variable. If I only get a year out of mine, I'll still consider it well worth the price.UPDATE: Well, those final words in my initial review proved to be prophetic: after a little over a year of use, I walked into the kitchen to find the GFCI kicked off and water all over the floor. My guess is that the water hose either burst or came off inside, because there was no outward sign of a problem. I didn't bother getting it fixed because of an impending move; just gave it away to someone who was going to try to repair it himself. My evaluation stands: loved it, feel like I got my money's worth out of it during the year it worked; but add me to the list of people dissatisfied with the product's durability.",4,I loved it!

I was worried about everything from the dishwasher being damaged during shipping to the ease of setting it up, as well as its cleaning capabilities. My biggest worry was having to deal with bad customer service, which was a major theme from some of the worst reviews I read back in February when I made this purchase. I am extremely happy to report, after 8 months of continuous use (at least once a day & sometimes twice a day), that this little dishwasher has proven itself to be an essential part of our tiny kitchen.First, let me report the negatives. Some of the worries I had were not entirely unfounded. The dishwasher arrived in a relatively flimsy box with almost no protection (e.g., styrofoam, packing peanuts) except for the cardboard itself. My order arrived undamaged but I can easily see how others may not be so lucky. After unboxing the dishwasher, there were very few instructions in the booklet provided but, admittedly, there are very few things to do to actually set it up. Being a relatively handy person, I figured out how to attach the product & make it work in about 15 minutes. My faucet has an aerator at the end where the water comes out & all I had to do was unscrew that piece & screw on the funnel-shaped attachment piece that came with the dishwasher. I do not remember any other details about the attachment process (since it was 8 months ago) but I can see how someone less handy would be frustrated with the lack of instructions. Lastly, the electrical cord that comes with this unit is not very long (~3 ft). Since the dishwasher has to be placed at or above the level of the sink for proper drainage & it needs to be close to the faucet for water intake, I imagine that some people would have problems with the short electrical cord if there is not an outlet near the kitchen sink.Overall, I would say that the negatives I mentioned are minor, given your order arrives in working & undamaged conditions.Now here are the major pluses. This dishwasher does an excellent job of properly cleaning our dishes, cutleries, tupperwares, & even small pots & pans that fit inside. No pre-rinsing is necessary as long as all large pieces of food are removed. Since we do not let food harden onto our dishes before we wash them, I cannot speak to its capabilities in that respect. One of the 3 options for running the dishwasher is ""rinse"" & I suppose that anyone who wants to let the dishes sit over night can just use this function to rinse them so that food would not harden onto them. The other two options are ""normal"" & ""heavy"". Most of the time, we just use the ""normal"" option but we do like the ""heavy"" option when we manage to fit a lot of things in there or when we think they are especially greasy. As far as I can tell, all this latter option does is washing them longer with an extra cycle of rinse as well.I think that there are 2 variables that are very important in terms of getting dishes clean; they are the water temperature & the placement of the things that you want to clean. The hot water in our building is already very hot & that certainly helps to get the grease off. There is also a heating element in the dishwasher that makes the water scolding hot & most things come out squeaky clean because of that. As for the placement of things inside the dishwasher, it can be a little tricky to optimize what little space there is. As advertised, we have no problems fitting a 4-person place setting, with 4 large plates, 4 little plates, 4 sets of cutleries, & 4 mugs. With just two of us eating most of the time, it usually means that we can do a day's worth of dishes at night. We find that it is easiest to leave things outside of the dishwasher until there is enough for a load & then figure out what should go where. It can be like a puzzle but it's really not too bad.One final tip is that by default, the ""vent"" function is turned on. This is supposed to help dry things inside but we do not use it as we find that air drying works best & saves energy. In our unit, there was no instruction of how not use that option. By trial & error, we figured out that by pressing one of the option button twice (i.e., pressing ""normal"" twice for the normal option), the ""vent"" function is turned off.Overall, we love our little Haier dishwasher. We have saved lots of time, effort, & water by not doing handwashing & it fits great in our tiny place.",5,No real complaints after 8 months...just praises.,1224374400,"10 19, 2008"

Pots and pans don't do so well, and larger ones won't fit, despite it having a special pots and pans cycle. Also, drain hose comes loose after 1-3 uses and you'll have to open the back of the washer to reattach it (Haier needs to offer a kit to fix this problem if they plan to continue selling this model and expect to have happy customers, esp repeat customers.). This means I've had to make an effort to keep an eye on this dishwasher rather than it just doing its job. You will need to get some type of device, or Haier's special stand, if you need to move the machine/store it away. I use an 18"" square shaped wood planter rolling base which fits perfect and was inexpensive. (This machine is too big to be a countertop model) I've had portable dishwashers in the past, of slightly different design and manufacture, and have not had the problems and quirks like with this machine. Shipping was a huge issue, the box is very large and very heavy.(UPS left a note rather than knocking on the door to deliver it, someone was home waiting for it. I finally got them to deliver it as they should but they still wouldn't bring it up 5 steps onto the porch.)

A1LDT4W8GKR1PJ,B00005O64S,Brittany L. Ensign,"[10, 11]","We purchased this dishwasher about 6 months ago, in spite of the rather mixed reviews that it has gotten.  It has come in very handy for us.  It is perfect for a small apartment!  It seems that some reviewers were expecting a miracle machine, but it really comes down to ""you get what you pay for.""  If you want a top quality appliance that will last forever, then you should probably invest in something different.  For a young couple looking for a temporary solution, we couldn't be happier!  Not sure why people were having such difficulty with setup, etc... it went together in a snap.As for the flooding problems, I think that it is important to note that there is a removable drain filter that needs to be cleaned off periodically.  This prevents food from clogging up the drainage system.  The filter lifts right out of the bottom of the machine.  We usually take it out and rinse it under hot water after each use.  You should also be around to shut off the water faucet relatively quickly after each use, otherwise water just continues to flow through the hose and a build-up of pressure could cause the seals to burst and, again, flood your kitchen.  Simple maintenance like this should prevent many of the problems that other users are reporting.  I can't stress enough that this is not like an installed dishwasher and therefore, is not operated as such.  If you expect a dishwasher that you can just load and leave, then you should expect to pay for such a machine.As another user noted, the heated dry cycle is completely useless.  It takes extra time and just streaks up your dishes.  Turning it off took a little bit of guess work, but we eventually figured out that you just have to press the button for whichever cycle you want to run (regular or heavy) twice when starting the machine.  We just crack open the door of the washer when the cycle is complete and the dishes dry in minutes once the heat escapes.One more word of advice:  always make sure that you have hot water available when you are washing anything glass.  We found this one out the hard way.  Although the washer has a heating element for the wash cycle, it rinses using whatever water is coming through the faucet.  Your dishes will get very hot during the wash cycle then suddenly cold during the rinse, not an optimal condition for glass.",4,Handy little appliance ... great for the price!,1178928000,"05 12, 2007"

We purchased the Haier to put on her countertop.We noted a couple things right away and have a problem that is not yet fixed.The unit is designed tall and narrow and wouldn't fit under her cabinets.  While not a huge deal the unit has to sit out on a prime place of countertop and not tucked neatly under the cabinets as we'd prefer.Also noted was that the drain hose was not part of the sink attachement and just lays loosly in the sink.  While it seems to be working so far, there is a chance that it could somehow get pulled over the side of the sink and water could run all over the floor.  A better design would be to incorporate the drain hose into the fitting on the faucet to avoid this.The problem we have is that if you do not close the door while pressing it very tightly it will not run.  It beeps & errors and you have to turn it off then on, then open and close the door until you get it just right.  At first it did this only occasionally, but now it is happening all the time.  We went to the Haier website and sent an e-mail for assistance per the instructions, however as of today their has been no response.

Scott Strumello,"[11, 12]","I was somewhat hesitant about ordering given range of comments, but the price was right and the size was the only way I would ever have a dishwasher.  My first delivery was damaged, and it appeared that I was receiving a unit that had been opened once already and was subsequently re-taped closed.  Upon opening the box, the door would not open because the plastic on the door was cracked.  Also, my unit was missing ALL of the necessary hardware (there are only 2 pieces, but vitally important ones) for connecting to the sink, and also missing the a warranty registration card and user manual, so I promptly shipped it back to Amazon, which was inconvenient, but better than being stuck with a broken dishwasher.  When the new dishwasher arrived about 2 weeks later, I was very pleasantly surprised and I now have a dishwasher that works perfectly, and cleans dishes very well.I would suggest reading all of the other review comments, especially the one from the woman in Cambridge, MA on attaching to the sink because the instructions do not address this at all, and it WILL save you lots of time.  Also, another useful observation:  I attached the threaded piece to the sink, then the hose attachment piece (push VERY hard until the ball bearings are over the new faucet attachment.  You will leave the part with the hose threads attached to the sink as well, and then simply unscrew the hose from the dishwasher to detach).  Also, be sure to remove ALL of the red tape inside, including on the piece on the ceiling water jet (I missed that one the first time) and remove all styrofoam, which is everywhere.  Make sure you operate the dishwasher on a countertop or cart that is the same height as your sink because this drains with gravity force rather than an electric pump, so it will not drain properly if the dishwasher is placed lower than the sink.  The good news is that the product works great and I am pleased with the quality,  just be sure to scrutinize it closely upon delivery and do not hesitate to return it if anything is cracked, broken, missing or doesn't look like the pictures.

A2Z8W82VJU8I78,B00005O64S,C. White,"[12, 12]","The size of my family has shrunk over the years and it's now just me and two kids still at home.  I've had a Haier freezer for a few years now with no problems, so despite the mixed reviews I decided to give this a shot.For the first hours I had it I wasn't sure I would be keeping it.  ""4 place settings"" didn't look like they would fit in there, and all of the pieces that are taped to the inside were loose - indicating a less than smooth shipment to my house.My major issue is with the manual:* It assumes the product arrives with all the pieces in place.* It assumes that everyone is familiar with kitchen sink faucet inserts.1) The picture/drawing doesn't show all the pieces in their places and instructs you to remove the tape and put them back in the position they started.  As I mentioned, mine arrived with the pieces OUT of place.  The filter only has two directions it can go, one with the little handle toward the door, or it can go towards the inside of the unit.  I chose the former position and called it good.  Similarly, the utensil rack didn't naturally fit into its own ""spot"" and the diagram just shows the general area it goes into, not the rack in place.  Finally I just looked at the display picture more closely and put in the rack how it looked to be set.  I still don't like how it just kind of sits in the middle of things.2) The manual gives a list of items you will need to install.  Oddly, this list comes after the troubleshooting section of the manual.  The list: Scissors, Phillips Screwdriver, Standard Screwdriver, Pliers, Wrench, Tape Measure, Gloves, Level.  Basically the instructions that follow the list are to place the unit on a horizontal flat surface near the sink, CONNECT THE QUICK CONNECT SINK ADAPTER TO THE COLD WATER FAUCET, put the drain hose into the sink, and to plug it into a 115 volt outlet.  That's essentially it. The diagram shows the dishwasher, the hoses, and a faucet with arrows telling you what things are.  It does not show everything hooked up.Notice the wording of the capitalized portion.  There IS no ""cold water faucet""; there is a faucet spout and hot and cold knobs or handles.  There is not a word about what to do with each item on the list.  I most certainly did NOT need scissors, screwdrivers of either type, a wrench, a tape measure, gloves, or a level to install this thing.  Just your average pliers (not needle nose) to unscrew the original faucet tip, and to tighten the adapter tip.  The products dimensions are given, and you should have a designated flat surface for the product near your sink - that's simple enough. The rest of the item on the list seem to just be filler - or there to confuse you.Seriously, how difficult would it have been to say ""unscrew/remove the tip of your faucet"" (small picture of counterclockwise removal); explain how the quick connect sink adapter separates ""push white ring down and remove top portion of adapter - this piece replaces your faucet tip"" (picture of quick connect sink adapter disconnected from each other - top portion shown being installed clockwise); connect other piece of quick connect adapter to the outlet hose (picture more optional here, most people can SEE how that gets connected like a garden hose - unlike the inside of a faucet); ""push down white ring and put hose part of adapter over the faucet part until it clicks into place""?  I mean really...I finally get all of that figured out (couple of hours), then I became puzzled by what the manual said about pouring in dishwasher detergent.  It says to ""pour in detergent into open compartment that is located on the inside of the door"".  Sounds simple enough - except the ""open compartment"" is merely an indent.  Logistically this made no sense to me - it was all going to run down into the bottom of the dishwasher, right?  I called the company and asked them what on earth was it there for if all the detergent was going to run into the bottom anyway - and why they referred to an indent as a ""compartment"" or a ""dispenser"" alternatively when it was not by definition.  Eventually the man came back to say that it was really more of a measuring device, and that is exactly how this washer was designed to operate. Okayyy then.All the little irritations out of the way I decide to finally run it.  It was quieter than I expected, faster than I expected, and better at cleaning than I expected.  I read another review that said the vented/dry feature is a waste of time - I agree.  Just crack the door after the cycle and forget about them for a while; the dishes will be more dry than the vented dry will do and will use less energy.I don't think I could manage without this little machine now.  I run it at least once a day, sometimes twice if there are a few extra dishes and/or cookware, and over weekends when we are all home at the same time.  We just rinse dishes after use throughout the day and add them to the dishwasher.  I run it in the later evening and leave the door partially open overnight when it is done.  In the morning, we have clean dishes to start the day and no dirty dishes accumulate in the sink throughout the day.  That is well worth the initial hassle to me!And don't go feeling bad that some people ""got"" the faucet thing right away and are a little condescending to those who didn't.  It's an instruction manual for Pete's sake - if they can bother to mention how to open a labeled door latch, then they certainly can (and should have) better explained their adapter install process.",4,I Really Like It...Now,1253318400,"09 19, 2009"

If you have a basic working knowledge of the kitchen sink, setup is pretty elementary.  If you do not have this knowledge, then setting up a dishwasher is the least of your troubles.The dishwasher arrived dented, and oddly soaking wet...?  The box and interior of the unit were dryer than the desert I live in, but the exterior was completely drenched.  The dent was small enough for me to not worry about the hassle of sending it back or repairing...so onward!This unit is too tall (21"") to work under most cabinets, so you will have to find somewhere else to put it.  The hoses are pretty long, so you should be able to find ample room within their reach.After connecting the intake hose to the faucet and turning on the water, it was obvious it's designed for pretty low pressure systems.  Undaunted by a high-pressure shower, I directed the drain hose down the drain and let her fly.The first real problem that one will notice is this thing is hideously LOUD.  It is so loud; I had to double the volume on the TV in the next room just to hear it.  It washes nicely though, so perhaps it's worth it.Next problem: the drain hose is gravity fed.  After the drain hose vomited all over the floor, it was apparent the dishwasher needed to be located somewhere higher than the sink, which in my apartment required some creative use of phone books.The normal cycle seems to take forever, and when it is done, the dishwasher beeps violently for something to be done.  The beep is annoying, but not as loud as the cycle, so it works out.Considering the price, I think the old adage ""what you pay for is what you get"" sums up this machine pretty well.  It isn't destined to last a good long time, but it does clean dishes and fits in my tiny apartment.  If you don't mind a loud dishwasher, I would probably recommend this unit to you.

I read the trouble-shooting and some other customer tips on-line. Apparently, there was a problem with our water level sensor; it would not reset itself after each load. I figured out a handy little trick: you have to shake and tilt the machine back on it's hind legs. Doing this resets that sensor and the machine will start.In the meanwhile, I contacted customer service. They were a huge hassle to deal with. They said they'd have repairs call me. Everytime they called I was at work even though I gave them a specific time frame. They never left a message or a return number. The number on my caller Id didn't accept incoming calls.After several months of phone tag, shaking and tilting of the machine finally quit working. My boyfriend had to remove the back panel to locate the sensor. We tried ordering the part ourselves but Haier was out of the $11.99 sensor and wasn't going to have anymore available for purchase. My boyfriend, who is Korean, came up with a clever idea. He used one of his chopsticks to reset the sensor before each use.After a few more service calls I finally connected with a sympathetic representative, he really understood my frustration. He ordered a replacement machine for me. All I had to do was pay $14.99 and mail in the serial number and 6"" of the electric cord.A few week later my new unit arrived.

Nice and clean.My only *complaint* is the silverware basket is, to me, excessively small.  I use a ton of them and the handles on my knives are rather fat, only two of them would fit in the space.

I ordered this unit from a different retailer (wallyworld) and they sent me a different version of this product that only used (1) lower spray arm. I researched portable dishwashers, before deciding on this unit, solely because it has (2) spray arms (supposedly). So double check, before you purchase, or make sure the return policy is solid. Lastly, the problems concerning cycling, and the 'fault' warnings, may very well be avoided by using the proper temperature levels (or just use cold water). My unit ran fine for 3 full cycles, but then cramped up - getting out of sync with itself. I believe this happens because the thing overheats, if your water supply is too hot.

It gets the dishes as clean as any larger machine I've used, and you'll be amazed at how much you can cram in there. If there's a big mess, you just do two loads.If you're clever, you'll just plumb the water supply into the connection under the sink, so you don't have to connect it to the end of the faucet, which renders the faucet unusable for the duration of the wash cycle.Another feature which I had to modify is the buzzer that alerts you to the end of the cycle, among other things. First, it's obnoxiously loud, you couldn't start the machine before you went to bed because it sounds a little like a smoke alarm. Second, why do I care when the cycle is done? Have you ever heard a dishwasher do that before? So, I opened the control panel and clipped one lead off the buzzer.

A2OR94VN7XQCUO,B00005O64S,"Edward Scott ""ewscott""","[1, 2]","I originally bought this in spite of the mixed reviews because most of them had to do with installation problems and I thought I was smart enough to do that even if no instructions were sent.  The price was right and there were quite a few reviews by people who sounded like they knew what they were doing and they liked it.It arrived quickly and with no damage.  I originally planned to install the unit under the countertop next to the sink, but realized that would put the pushbuttons down by the floor, plus the rack would be very low for loading and it just looked like it would be more hassle than help.So I installed the unit temporarily on the countertop next to the sink.  This required no instructions, since obviously all I needed to do was remove the threaded aerator on the sink faucet and screw in the one enclosed with the dishwasher.  I ran the drain line next to the water line so that I could drop it into the sink when in use.  I plugged the unit in and ran an empty load with cascade.  No problem.  I put in some dishes and ran them, no problem.  The only problems I've had at all with this machine was with my ultra-glossy plates (see my other reviews) when I put in too much cascade, they tend to get white streaks.  I think most problems with streaking in most dishwashers are caused by using too much detergent... it doesn't take much!Then the time came that I wanted to regain my counter space, so I started looking at how I could do that to my advantage.  Voila!  behind my sink, on the other side of the wall, there is an outdoor closet that houses my water heater and various other stuff, and the sink drainpipe goes through there.  So I installed the unit IN THE WALL, OVER THE COUNTERTOP AND TO THE LEFT OF MY SINK!  This allows the buttons to be right in front of me and the door opens about a foot over the top of the counter.  This way I can pull the rack right out as I scrape and rinse the dishes in the sink and just load them right into the rack without even bending over.  It also removes about 75% of the noise!  With the door opening a foot over the countertop, I seldom have to move anything on the counter to open the door.I've had my dishwasher for a year now and have never been disappointed in the money spent.  Of course, with the hole in the wall right over the sink, I'll have to replace this unit when it dies with a similar one, but no big deal!  Once you learn how much detergent is needed and how to load the rack efficiently, this unit is JUST AS GOOD AS THE BIG MAYTAG downstairs!I couldn't be happier!I wouldn't do this installation unless you can let the unit hang into a similar space on the other side of the wall... say like a garage or similar utility room like mine, just in case you have a catastrophic leak.  My installation is much safer and quieter than under the counter and much easier on my back.",5,"In-Wall Installation, no problem!",1204675200,"03 5, 2008"

AHN5GDLZAS0MT,B00005O64S,Forest430,"[9, 11]","For anyone who has lived with a regular sized dishwasher for a long time, the Haier HPT18PA may seem inadequate. It snuggly fits dinner plates but it doesn't fit any of my pots and pans. Compared to the latest full size models, it's loud and featureless. BUT, if you're like me (and I would imagine that if you've stumbled onto this review that you might be) someone who's had to hand wash cups and plates for years, it's a Godsend. With a little care, it does its job perfectly every time and for me, the time it saves, the relief it brings for not having to do the dishes, this little helper brings me a lot of joy. Having used it for a few months (pretty much every day) I haven't experience any of the problems listed in past reviews. The quick release/hook-up to the sink is helpful and the wash cycles seem efficent enough to never leave stains or spots. A few tips: 1) Like any dishwasher, rinse off or anything bigger than a rice grain before running the washer. Although it has a decent grid to catch all food particles, I hear that a lot of leaks and problems start with clogged drains. 2) The ""Vent Dry"" cycle is useless so simply open door and pull the dish tray out half way to air dry after washer stops. 3) Completely turn off the hot water faucet before disconnecting the quick release valve. This is pretty obvious but it took me a while of splashing hot water to remember this. So, in conclusion, all of you hand washers out there, this is a solid machine that I highly recommened. I did a lot of research on other compact dishwashers out there but sadly there aren't many on the market. And since I haven't tried those others myself, I can't say this performs better over the other but I can certainly vouch for its consistent performance. And what more can you ask for in this size and price range? Excuse my crude analogy but it's like someone who's been walking all their life getting to drive a brand new reliable compact car.

The cannot tell me where it is or when I will receive it.Month 7: I receive the new dishwasher and hook it up.  It won't even start.  I call Haier, and they tell me I can have a new dishwasher.  I tell them I do not want a new one because of the problems in months 1-6.  The fighting begins.Months 8-9: I repeatedly call Haier, rarely get called back, get yelled at and hung up on by their customer service.Month 9: I give up and swallow the loss.The long version:Stay away from this dishwasher!  Before purchasing one, I read the reviews and saw the mix of both good and bad ones, but I was desperate for a dishwasher in my tiny apartment, and decided that I should give it a shot.  Huge mistake!When I received the dishwasher, it took me 5 trips to the hardware store and about $60 to purchase all of the necessary plumbing pieces and attachments to properly connect it so that that it would work.  I had to tighten all of the attachments daily in order to prevent it from leaking, and had to bolt the drainage hose down so it wouldn't spray my entire kitchen (picture a cobra dancing to a snake charmer) when it was draining.Within two weeks of using it, it began leaking huge amounts of water through the sides of the door when it was filling.  So, I purchased rubber hose to plug up the gaps, and began using it again.  After another 2 weeks (only 1 month of ownership) it completely stopped working!  So, I called Haier customer service, and they agreed to send me a new one.  After a month I had not received the new machine, so I began calling and they could not tell me where it was.  I called weekly for FIVE MONTHS before I finally received the new machine.I took it out of the box, hooked it up and turned it on, and NOTHING!  I tried over and over, but this one was a complete flop straight out of the box.  So, I called Haier and they again informed me they would send me a new one.  Mind you, at this point I had paid for the original dishwasher six months ago and only had one month of semi-functional use.  So I reminded them of the issues in receiving the first replacement and informed then I did not want a new machine, I wanted a refund.This is where the real roller coaster begins.  I was transferred all over the Haier customer service department, hung up on, lied to, not called back for weeks at a time.  At two different points, conversations were recorded in their logs that NEVER OCCURRED, in which I agreed to their terms.After THREE MONTHS of these fights, I threw out the dishwasher and informed Haier I wanted no further contact with their disfunctional company or their sub-par merchandise.

A18ODEEPLTWLX3,B00005O64S,Jared S. Gardner,"[7, 7]","We purchased this dishwasher 2 1/2 years ago because of our small apartment and figured it would do the job for 2 people. After looking at the mixed reviews, we were careful to keep our receipt in case the dishwasher malfunctioned.After 2 months, the machine broke and was replaced in around 3 weeks. Another 9 months later, it broke again (but still under the 1 year warranty). Haier replaced it in around 3 weeks and we noticed that the new unit was slightly different than the other two - it had a smaller spray in the top which allowed us to put in taller items. So far we have had this ""updated"" unit for well over a year with only minor inconveniences:1. The water hose does not like to stay on the faucet (especially with hot water), so every time another rinse is needed (3 times per wash), we must reattach the hose. This may be a serious problem for some people, but we have learned to accept it.2. Because we have very alkaline water, I have noticed some build-up on the heating coil. I believe this could be removed by some CLR and may not be an issue for other locations.3. I have never tried to use the ""heat dry"" feature because I heard from previous reviewers that it just breaks anyway. The unit does a good job of heating the water, and my dishes have always dried quickly. I believe that the unit does a good job of sanitizing the dishes because even when using cold water, the dishes come out very steamy.Overall, I think this is a good choice for people with limited space. Just keep your receipt in case it breaks. I think that the slightly updated design (since 2006) may present fewer problems than the 2005 units.",4,Works great... on the third try!,1181520000,"06 11, 2007"

We have had absolutely no problems with this machine it was so easy to set up, the instruction manual clearly indicates all the steps necessary. The hardest part was getting the cap off our own faucet to screw on the special locking attachment. All the hoses come attached. Just remove all the bright red tape inside that keeps moving parts from moving while shipping as the manual clearly indicates in 7 languages, Buy some cascade Plug it into the wall, put the drain hose in the sink, Snap the intake hose on to your faucet head, Turn on the HOT water and push the on button and selct your wash level in 23 minutes for a normal wash with dry cycle you will have squeaky clean glasses. (your water must reach 120 degrees for proper cleaning and it helps if the machine doesn't have to start from cold.)  Steam will be released from the back of the machine through the vent during the dry cycle so you should leave a ventilation space between the wall and it, some people will think the collected condensation is a leak I keep a towel back there. It holds so much more than advertised I can really pack it in and it all comes out clean. Of course if you burnt something in a pot you should give it a scrub before you put it in but no machine can help a bad cook. You do lose counter space since its a gravity drain and not a pump and its too heavy at 47  pounds to move around, so it should sit next to the sink; if you put it on a rolling cart make sure the platform of your cart is atleast as high as your counter or higher otherwise the water will backup and flood. I consider the loss of counter space no big deal since that spot either always had dishes waiting to be washed or clean and drying in the rack. It takes up no more space the drying rack did. It is very quiet, my refridgerator and air conditioner makes more noise.

A1RD1ML0NA3P2U,B00005O64S,J. Hutchison,"[4, 4]","Edit/Update: It now leaks, a lot.  It's leaking from inside the unit where the water pump attaches to the bottom.  That didn't last too long, did it?Quick:-Near-useless manual-No installation instructions; Frustrating.-/+Bigger than I thought+Cleans well+Holds a lot for the size+Saves time/energy+Very little detergent neededDetailed:I was so excited to get this, because I hate HATE washing dishes.  My first job was as a dishwasher in a restaurant, and that became old real fast.  I was slightly disappointed, but there is good here.  Bad first, with a good finish.First of all, I'd like to say that I bought this from another website.  It said ""2 level wash system"" but the unit I actually received only had one. When I got mine it had ""1"" stickers placed over all the number 2's on the box, and alas there is only one sprayer inside (on the bottom).  The upper sprayer is not installed.  However, this wasn't necessarily a bad thing.  More on that later.The first thing that was unexpected was the size.  It's about 20in tall, and was 3 inches too tall to fit on my counter because of the cabinets.  However, I had a small area next to the sink, and a small table, so problem solved.The next issue I had was the manual.  I'm one of those people that reads the whole thing front to back before I use anything.  I was surprised that it was full of some useful information, but lacking SO much.  For instance:-In one part, it says the water should be between 130-150 degrees, but in another part says you should only connect it to the cold water faucet. (For the record, I use hot 130 degree water.  Works well.)-It doesn't have clear installation instructions at all.-In the manual, it says you can turn off the heated dry function, but doesn't say how.  The heated dry indicator LOOKS like a button, but it's not.  After a week I discovered by accident you have to press the wash selection button twice to turn it off.-Doesn't have clear operating/usage instructions.Another issue with this is the water inlet hose.  Once installed it IS very easy to connect and disconnect.  However, once the machine is run, you have to turn the water off and disconnect it.  Simple, right?  WELL, the pressure builds up in the pipe even after you turn off the sink.  The first time I disconnected it I got hot water exploding in my face, and it wasn't pleasant.  SO, you have to let it sit for a few minutes to let the pressure leak out from the hose.The last issue is minor.  The tray that holds the dishes doesn't come out very far.  This is probably to resist the machine tipping over, but it's rather difficult to get normal to large sized dishware inside, but is possible.Now, FINALLY, the good parts:The one sprayer has so far cleaned everything properly, as long as everything is placed facing or angled down like normal.  Also, because of the small size inside, I feel that a 2nd overhead sprayer would severely limit the types of dishes I would be able to fit in the unit, so only having one sprayer inside turned out to be a good thing, since there is extra room inside for bigger plates and taller cups.It uses very little dishwasher detergent - about 2 tablespoons for a whole load.  This means a bottle goes very far.I feel like I save energy and paper towels now.  The hot water heats up the dishes so much that the heated dry function isn't needed (although it's there if your water isn't so hot and you need it).  As long as I crack the door open right after the wash ends to let out the steam, the heat in the plates literally dries itself off.  Also, it doesn't use as much water as I would washing and rinsing them manually.Another good thing is that the picture is pretty accurate.  I can fit about 4 meals worth of plates, bowls, silverware, and cups in this thing before it's full.  I live alone and run it about once every 2 days.And the best part, I hardly EVER have to wash things manually now.  Mainly only large pans.  Everything else goes in the dishwasher!Other thoughts:In the manual, it says you have to place this right next to the sink, above or level with the sink because of the way it drains.  However, I think the manual is wrong again.  First of all, the hoses and cord is 4-5ft long, so it doesn't have to be RIGHT next to the sink.  Also, when it drains it seems that it pumps the water out, instead of just letting it drain.  I haven't tried it yet, but I think you could place it below sink level and be ok.Normally I'd say this is PERFECT as a gift for a college student living a dorm or something like that.  However, because of the pain and confusion in installation, I'd hold off unless you know what you're doing and can install it for them, or they are somewhat experienced with installing a dishwasher.

Is the sink even useable after install? Do you have to disconnect it everytime you want to use your sink? Is there storage provision for the drain hose when not being used or is this thing always hanging in your sink.

Fast, quiet, effective, just the right size for a single person who would otherwise have to let dirty dishes accumulate for several days before running a load. And the counter top location is a big plus, the fact that you don't have to bend down to stick something in it means that I'm less likely to succumb to temptation and leave dishes in the sink. If you regularly cook and use a lot of pots, however, you may find yourself running more than one load a day and should consider a larger unit.I've found the cleaning at least as effective as the full-sized Kitchenaid downstairs, or any full-sized dishwasher I've ever used, which is to say that if you use a good detergent (Cascade) you don't have to prerinse dishes unless they have cheese one them. Pots with cooked-on material will require a preliminary scouring.One minor drawback: this dishwasher doesn't have a disposer, which means that there's a filter to rinse. It takes a few seconds. (On the plus side, that's one of the reasons the dishwasher is so quiet.) Also, one of the settings didn't work on my unit, something that in ordinary circumstances would have led me to remove a star. But this is just so damn handy that I gave it five anyway.How can someone not know that faucets have threads on them?

You will need to buy a kitchen cart in order to have room for it. Make sure that the cart has wheels on it so that you can roll it over to the sink when you would like to do dishesIt says that you have a dry cycle, but you really do not. It is vented dry, which is a fancy way to say air dry. This also means that the inside of the dishwasher always has beads of water throughout it.It washes the dishes perfectly, but it can be a challenge to fit everything into it.I have not found any defects. :)The set up is annoying. This is simply, because the dishwasher does not come with a full set of instructions. The hose will not attach to every sink at first. You do NOT have to buy an extra attachment. Instead there is a piece that you need to remove on the end of the hose, which allows for you to attach it to your sink. The people at Home Depot can explain it better than me. :)Basically, for the amount of money this is good for a family of 1-2 people. I do not suggest it if you have more than 3 people in your family. If you do not mind buying a kitchen cart, and air/towel drying your dishes... it is a great dishwasher.",4,The truth about it!

Even if it broke tomorrow (which I worry about from reading other reviews), it'd be worth the money for the pleasure it's given me.The unit I have is the 2nd generation model (with only one sprayer, on the bottom.) Its not exactly compact -- its deceptively tall, but fits my counter with an amazing .5"" to spare. :)The quick release hose for the sink works great, although the little nozzle that remains when the hose is disconnected is pretty pathetic -- I bought a little spray nozzle from Lowes that I clip on when the dish washer isn't in use.The basket isn't huge, but fits plates and frying pans with a little jiggling. I actually took my basket out and turned it around, which puts the silverware basket in the front, which I prefer. My only complaint is that the wheels seem a little too small for the track, and it occasionally falls out of place when moving in and out.The interior is plastic, which is fine with me (less likely to chip), and the exterior is the same as any white appliance. My unit arrived with no damage, unlike other reports. They packed it amazingly well (straight from the factory), with plenty of bubble wrap. Perhaps they heard?I agree with other reviews about the loud beeping at the end of cycle - its annoying, but no big deal. And you can always clip the speaker.It tooks some experimenting, but using a generous squirt of Palmolive (about 1/3 cup) and the longer heavy cycle generally leaves my dishes squeaky clean. If you don't pre-rinse your dishes, stuff tends to collect on the filter, but its easy to clean. Even when I put in dishes with caked-on-grease, it cleans them well. Some of my pans with long-since burned-on grease have begun to flake clean.. amazing!The unit is comparably noisy to any dishwasher (maybe a little less).Overall, its a terrific unit for the price.

Instead I contacted some local repair companies.  Only one would look at it and it turned out to be a design flaw.  I could replace the same part over and over as it failed or give up.I can't afford either option so I am back to hand washing for now.The best advice I can give is that it seems to be the water heater is too close to a control card.

It was compact and comfortable while it worked. The real problem of this machine is in its poor reliability and after service.Here is my case. When my dishwasher stopped working, I checked Haier America website for available service centers. I could find one after three times of phone calls, because the previous two quit the job of fixing Haier. (Now the third service center joined the club and I'll talk about how this fact has driven me crazy, later.)So they sent an engineer. My dishwasher, according to the person, became out of order because its control board was transformed by heat. The engineer showed me how poor the isolation between the washing compartment and the control board was.After the engineer checked the dishwasher, I had to wait for the arrival of a new control board from Canada(!). But one week later, the service center called me to say that they failed to get a control board of the model and so I would have to call Haier America for a new machine. (My dishwasher is still under warranty.)So did I. The problem was that I had to have the service center call Haier to make it sure that the machine is not fixable, told Haier customer service. They even need a document to prove the fact! Being worse, the service center who sent an engineer joined the club of once-a-haier-service-center-but-quit-now. Nevertheless, the service center people were mostly willing to help, but the problem was that Haier needed a printed/written document to prove the machine's unfixability. I hope that they kept the document even after quitting Haier service, but the service center person who received my phone call concerning this problem said to that they would have to check it.Anyway, now it's about one month after the machine started malfunction, and still I have to wait for the shipment of a new machine at least another two days, under the supposition that the service center kept the document of my dishwasher and sent it to Haier in normal fashion. So many &quot;if&quot;s.Here is a bottom line. By and large, Haier is a relatively new brand in the USA whose products' reliability was not proven.

(The only downside was that Thursday J&R; started FREE delivery - could have used that $25.)I've had a Haier clothes washer since January - love it - and this set-up was even simpler.  After owning five portable dish and clothes washers over the years, the faucet adjustment seems old hat.  Just wish the hoses and cord were a bit longer.  I have to place the machine on top of the stove for now and stretch everything across the tiny counterspace.In 1968 when I bought my first home, my absolute required purchase was a countertop dishwasher.  It was a round plastic carousel, you used regular dish liquid and today seems like a toy compared to the Haier.  Now just starting retirement, it seems ironic that once again my most anticipated possession was a countertop machine for those dreaded dishes.  Well worth it.*****A few more thoughts -- For me, with the hot water on full, the regular cycle is 36 minutes and the heavy duty is 46.  So for the extra cleaning the 10 minutes is worth it- All my dishes are heavy stoneware so it's a bit of a trick to load.

The Haier is the only one with two spray arms. It has the tallest interior height, and was the cheapest. This unit lacks a sanitizing wash, a powered drain pump, and a stainless steel interior. Despite its low ratings I decided that two spray arms were worth the gamble. My first thoughts were that the manual is not well written, the vent dry is useless, it is as loud as an older under counter model, beeps more than necessary, and only cleans dishes that are dirty not crusty. This model has it's quirks but does what it is designed to do.After about one year it stopped working (5/2004 just out of warranty). Rather than sending the unit for repair I decided to open it and see what was wrong. One of the wires had burned through it's connector and was causing a fault in the computer. A simple repair but kind of a pain to diagnose. Since then the unit has faithfully worked every day sometimes twice a day 1000+ wash cycles. Last week (11/2006). It started leaking. Slow at first than increased to a steady flow. Once again I decided to open the unit and see what was wrong. It was one of plastic water distribution channels that brings pressurized water from the motor to the top sprayer arm. I was surprised to see how cheap and poorly designed these vital parts were. But at an original cost of 175$ and over 1000 washes 17.5 cents per wash was well worth it. I have decided to buy the same model as a replacement. I will update in a few monthsIf you are handy, don't need instructions and don't mind tinkering with this unit it does it's job reasonably well for it's price.The key to this product is not to expect it to do what it was not designed to do.""UPDATE""My new unit arrived today (11/14/06). Despite having the same model number the current units that are sold have a different design. Gone is the top sprayer arm. SO, the reason I bought haier in the first place no longer applies. The good news is the design of the internal parts is much better than they were in 2003. From looking inside I can see most of the leaking problems would have been resolved.

Let me tell you. It is a wonder. No more handwashing dishes,no more dreading doing the dishes, the only thing I dread is putting up the dishes but I've been that way since I was young and it was one of my assigned chores. It is great for those of you that live in apartments or have small kitchens, or want a dishwasher for your basement but not having to permanently install one.Washes microwave containers well, large pots, and dinner plates.I have found that since I have large dinner plates I do need to put them in every other slot and it helps to use the ""heavy"" wash selection. I also recommend using the ""heavy"" wash selection with pots and pans. It has washed some of my crustiest pots (as an experiment) in two ""heavy"" washes with no problem. I am able to fit 99% of all of my pots and pans in the dishwasher which is a huge plus. I have had mine since late Spring 2003 and it is Fall 2003, dishwasher is still going strong sitting on top of my washing machine for good drainage. (I need to conserve space). You can easily move it from place to place if necessary, I weigh b/w 100 - 115 lbs and can lift the dishwasher w/o dishes with no problem. If it has dishes in it then picking it up is a bit of struggle. I do recommend you do not select ""vented dry"" when you are washing thin plastic items...the heat will melt the items with no problem. I love the ""rinse/hold"" option because I run all my dishes through it and then go back and do a full cycle later on during the week if necessary. I do recommend that you run a full cycle empty once a week or after you've done all your dishes add a scoop of dishwashing detergent along with a huge scoop of baking soda. It helps keep it fresh and smelling clean. I found this out by one day not cleaing the filter screen and being in a rush. Running the empty cycle helps remove in food particles you may not be able to see and remove by hand.Make sure you have your drain hose secure so that it doesn't swing out and start emptying out on the floor. Yes, that happened to me but now I have secured it to the water inlet hose with ease so it isn't a worry anymore. Also, keeping your dishwasher at least an inch if not three or more inches higher than your drain truly gets your dishwasher completely drained. If you aren't able to, then easily, have a bucket near by and place the drain hose in the bucket (while sitting the bucket on the floor) at the end of the wash cycle and the rest of the water will drain out. Sink hookup is easy, fast, and uncomplicated. Installation is too. Washes my china with tenderness and no problem on the ""normal"" cycle.AND THIS IS COMING FROM SOMEONE WHO DESPISES HAND WASHING ANY TYPE OF DISH!

All it does is flash the control panel lights and beep when I try to turn it on. It had stopped in the middle of a wash cycle and has not worked since then.

I pre-soaked and rinsed the dirty dishes and loaded the dishwasher up(as recommended in the manual) and then turned it on. Dishes came out clean after the dishwasher was complete.Only 2 small complaints that I have.ONE: I went to the Haier web site and read the manual before purchasing. The manual shows a picture that the dishwasher has a upper spray arm, the one I received does not. I was a little upset that the manual would show this for this particular model but the model does not have the upper spray arm. I would think the dishwasher would do so much better if it actually came with the upper spray arm.TWO: The vent drying was not to good with the dishwasher I received. Not really upset about that cause the dishes are hot enough to let them air dry with the door slightly ajar or better yet, put them in a dish strainer to air dry(that is what I did anyway).I am only giving this 4 stars for the fact of the manual stating it should have an upper spray arm but as far as it doing it's intended job...

AULYPJZLSR4OQ,B00005O64S,"Ms Eve Hands ""Eve3""","[3, 4]","I love this item; the value for money is great.  However I do think a couple of 'cautionary' things ought to be mentioned (would have been useful to know before buying it - for that price, I'd have bought it anyway, but some might not) .  First, it has NO PUMP, therefore it MUST be positioned over a sink so that it can drain.  Period.  Second, it has no drier - so the dishes don't come out dry, they all need a little dab with a towel.  Third, the cutlery tray is a bit ridiculously small....big spoons don't fit unless you put them in handle size down.  I see no reason why it couldn't have been designed a bit roomier.  Fourth, the issue concerning the size of the plates is relevant (a previous reviewer mentioned this - thanx!) but for me it wasn't the size which caused problems but the fact that the rack doesn't really hold the plates upright for some reason.  Fifth: the Normal' wash is really strictly only for very lightly soiled items - even with high-end dishwasher liquid.  So generally I end up using the so-called 'Heavy' setting...and never would attempt to wash pots in it (which is fine by me but some people would mind).  Sixth: The open/close handle is a bit thin and flimsy, I hope it won't break off at some point in future...and there's no good reason why it can't be a bit sturdier!  BUT OTHERWISE, it's great!! - full wash inside 45 minutes for the 'normal' and an hour for the 'heavy', and it's VERY quiet, which i love.  I haven't received the first electric bill yet but I'm hoping it's not going to make much of a difference!I do think that the designers/manufacturers should tweak the design of this but overall, it's great value for the money and such a super convenience for someone single who likes to cook light meals and doesn't want to wait a week until a full-size washer is stacked and ready to run!

It's a bit on the noisy side, but I didn't expect anything different given the price and the compact sizeRecently though I have run across a problem that does give me some concern. After a few months of use I noticed water on the counter each morning. I eventually discovered that the spray arm had split in two where the two halves are glued/heat sealed together. I looked online for parts and quickly discovered numerous posts from folks who had terrible experiences dealing with Haier directly, so I decided to order a couple spray arms directly from a 3rd party source and not file a warranty claim with Haier. The second spray arm lasted about the same amount of time before experiencing the same failure, now I'm on my 3rd. So far I haven't figured out any sure fire way to repair the arms, so I suspect I will wind up ordering a couple more. Too bad, as it's a very nice unit aside from this issue. While searching online I only came across one other person who experienced this same issue, so maybe they just had a bad batch of arms. I guess I'll find out when I order my next set",4,"Pint sized DW gets the job done, but have run into a nagging problem",1283644800,"09 5, 2010"

However, in the middle of February, the machine broke completely down on me, and I was forced to call Haier to repair my machine. Within a couple of days they sent a contracted repairman, and the repairman discovered that the control board of the dishwasher broke down. After some miscommunication on my part, the technician, and Haier, they finally shipped me a factory new dishwasher. I was without a dishwasher for one month, but since I'm rather patient - considering that it takes time to contract the repairman, send them the cord as proof that I'm not using the machine, and them shipping the machine - they still responded fast. So, unlike some of the other customers who did not receive such good customer service, I would rate Haier with 'very good' on their customer service. Now, if this machine works for a longer period, it will get five stars (since it washes the dishes as good as some bigger machines do), however if it does break down again, it would hit the one star rating for me (i.e. not worth buying).

The manual is insufficient, otherwise it is super, but read below for important clues!My mom NEVER wanted a dishwasher for the waste of space and money until her hands started stripping off skin.I forced this installation on her and now she is happy!Only part of one half of one cabinet was lost instead of a whole slot in her kitchen and the machine works well!I was surprised at how much dishes this little unit can fit with proper care and arranging.While clearly not as big as a full sized washer it does a neat job for a 2 person or bachelor household and it cleans as good as a larger unit!Caveats:The manual is a little thin in details - but probably already more than most people will read anyway!IMPORTANT:The drain hose NEEDS to be mounted at a drain point LOWER than the exit point on the machine, which is at the bottom of the dishwasher!Otherwise it will NOT drain!The complicated setup that other users complain about is no worse than with anything that invloves plumbing.If you are threatened by the mere thought of plumbing, then forget about setting up ANY machine that invloves water and/or electricity and allow yourself to get milked for lots of money by a ""Professional"".Otherwise do this:Do NOT expect to have this up and running out of the box without a trip to the hardware store to get proper inlet and drain adapters, T-adapters for water supply and drain, and a shut off valve for water supply to get a proper installation.With anything plumbing and electric there is never an easy ride if you want it done the right way, but I wasn't bothered by that fact, as I'm a handyman.Hint:Ask for pipe dope, aka pipe joint sealant, for your shut off valve and supply adapter joints! A shut off valve will allow you to turn off the water to your dish washer and give you peace of mind when leaving home - same goes for ANY water supplied gizmo!Why didn't I hook it to mom's fancy spray hose faucet? They don't make some things very solid anymore and the damned plastic head of that spray sink head had no thread to screw in this dishwasher's included supply coupling! So back to doing it the ""proper"" way - with a T-joint and valve in a fized installation!So - if DIY plumbing is no problem for you, get this little wonder!If DIY plumbing is NOT your bag, get it ANYWAY, because if you need its small size, this is a great unit, and you will need a real plumber anyway, regardless of which washer you buy!

A1YUNGUH8ATWU4,B00005O64S,QC,"[3, 3]","To preface this review, I got this unit used and it is being used in a two person apartment.The product came with a decent manual, not the best, but certainly not the nightmare some people described. To give an idea of how much info it contains, it has 24 pages for each of the three languages - English, French, Spanish. The description on how to hook it up isn't entirely clear, as the illustration for the sink isn't like any sink I've seen in the US. Nonetheless, with some common sense it shouldn't be that difficult to figure out. You only have three things to worry about - 1) the rubber hose which brings water into the unit, 2) the drain hose which dumps water out of the unit, and 3) the power cord. I had to go to Lowe's to get a sink adapter, since what came with the unit didn't fit the threads on the faucet. I think maybe most people have problems at first because they don't realize the nozzle part can unscrew from the faucet.Operation is pretty easy - turn on the water supply, plug it in, press the power button, press whatever wash cycle you want. I think the vented dry button on my unit is broken since pressing it doesn't seem to change anything. Setup and take down is simple, it maybe takes a minute or two to screw/unscrew everything. At first I was having problems securing the drain hose, once it dumped water all over the kitchen floor and I spent a good half an hour wiping it up. I came up with a solution where I secured the drain hose to the rubber hose with rubber bands, thus insuring that the drain hose drained into the sink and not the floor.This thing does a good job of cleaning the dishes, so long as everything is properly loaded, but there's the problem - loading it. The problem I have with the unit is not just its size, but the design of its interior. Some of the spokes are so close together it's plain impractical. You can fit plates in there, so long as they're not very big (I have a lot of plates that don't fit in there), but the design isn't very friendly to bowls bigger than a small cereal bowl.For two adults who basically use dishes/tupperware for all three meals, it's becoming clear that this dishwasher is inadequate for our needs. It's simply too small.

It's obvious from reading reviews that dozens of people, including me, have already been disappointed and cheated by this awful company. They create terrible products for which they provide inadequate (and even unethical) support. I overlooked all the negative reviews because I was so excited about the idea of a dishwasher in my little apartment, but this machine (as well as a Haier window AC unit I just disposed of) has been a complete nightmare every day since I purchased it one year ago. I have officially declared a lifelong boycott against Haier products, and ask you to join me so that this company can get what they deserve, leaving consumers everywhere better off.The day the dishwasher arrived, installation was difficult (which I was prepared for based on other reviews). We finally got it hooked up, loaded it and hit start, and it ran for 5 minutes, 26 seconds then quit and refused to drain. I reset it and tried again--same result. On the fourth attempt it finally worked (kind of). It went through all the cycles, but didn't drain the last two inches of water, and leaked where the hose attaches to the back.So I figured out I need to tighten all connections before beginning a wash, and I need to manually drain the last 2 inches of water each time. I'd estimate that this method worked about one in four times--the other times it would still quit at 5 minutes, 26 seconds. I called customer services about this, and they told me that there was nothing wrong with the machine, and that I needed to reset it, which did not solve the problem. It also began leaking through the sides of the door, so I had to block that by gluing in a rubber tube.After only 3 weeks, the dishwasher completely quit working. I received an error message every time I hit start, despite numerous attempts to reset. I called customer service, and they tried to walk me through a fix, but didn't even have information for the correct dishwasher. The representative repeated told me to push the door lock button, and became very frustrated when I told her that the door lock was a lever and not a button. She told me to ""Get a f---ing clue"" and hung up on me. When I called back I got a different representative and asked for a supervisor, and they transferred me to the woman who had just hung up on me! So, either they were dishonest about who the supervisor was or it was in fact the supervisor who cursed at me. I asked for her boss, and she informed me that she didn't have his phone number and he only worked Mondays from 2-6 am.I called back the next day, and spoke with another representative who told me to mail them the electric cord and they'd mail me a new dishwasher. I sent it the same day, with delivery confirmation that it arrived there 3 days later. After a week I had still not received any communication or a new machine, so I called. They claimed not to have received the cord. When I gave them the delivery confirmation information, they suddenly located the cord and informed me my new machine would arrive in 2-4 weeks. Five weeks later, still no machine. I began calling weekly and every time they informed me it had ""just been shipped"" and would arrive within a few days.SIX MONTHS and dozens of phone calls later, I finally received the new machine.I plugged it in, and it didn't work at all. The lights on the front wouldn't even turn on, so I assume something was faulty with the electrical connection. I called customer service, and the game began again. Send them the cord, and they'll send a new machine. I commented on the challenge of disposing of the old one, and they assured me if I mailed the receipt they would reimburse me for expenses.Two months after sending the cord and receipt, I had still received no reimbursement, no new machine. So, I began calling to request a refund based upon the fact that I had purchased the machine 9 months ago, and only used it for 3 weeks (during which time it worked about 25% of the time). I once again received a complete runaround. Every time I called to request a refund, the worker would offer to send me a replacement instead. I'd inform them that I'd been waiting for a replacement for 8 months and now require a refund. I was REPEATEDLY hung up on, I left daily messages for supervisors, which were never returned, and was actually read from their logs records of conversations that NEVER OCCURRED, during which they claimed I told them that the dishwasher had started working and I no longer needed a replacement or refund, and others when I allegedly told them that I had lost the electrical cord so couldn't mail it. I had in fact already mailed it and repeatedly sent them the delivery confirmation information.I hit the one-year anniversary of the original date of purchase last week and, quite against my better judgement and character, and simply out of complete exhaustion and infuriation, I have given up.

The Haier HDT18PA really seemed like my only option -- but the reviews on Amazon were so mixed. Finally, I bought it anyway in desperate hope that it would work.When I finally got the machine, it was a disaster.  I couldn't figure out how to hook it up.  The pieces didn't seem to fit my sink and the manual was useless -- it was a real mess.  I went to Home Depot to try to find a piece that would fit, but they assured me that the pieces that came with the machine (i brought them with me) had to actually fit my sink -- I was not putting it together right (remember, with no instructions, how could I know?) I went home, and tried for a week to get the pieces to fit -- Finally I got it right!  Then I tried to get it running -- no luck! ... Eventually I discovered a small piece of tape inside that was holding the water spinner from moving.And then ... FINALLY ... it worked.  This thing washed my dishes.  It washes small pots and pans covered with grease and all the nasty stuff I don't want to touch.  It's GREAT and so easy to use now that I got it hooked up.  Seriously -- it's small, but I usually cook for only two people -- and this covers the plates, glasses, and the sauce pot or whatever.  I'm truly in love with this machine.Now -- I'll try to save you the hassles I've gone through.  First, check your sink and see if you can unscrew something to reveal the threads on the faucet.  You may think your sink is so smooth that it looks like nothing can unscrew, but try it with some pliers or a wrench -- you may be surprised.  Anyway, there's a piece in the kit that then screws on to replace the piece you just unscrewed.  Then, there's another piece (the ""quick release"") piece that fits on the washer hose and then snaps onto that piece on your sink if you press down the white circle on it first. Once you attach the quick release piece to the piece on your faucet, you should be able to turn on the water without anything splashing or spraying.  At that point, you then turn on the dishwasher, and it works.And also, make sure to remove all the tape and foam from the inside of the machine -- it's all over the place -- you need to search hard.I think that a lot of the bad reviews stem from people who just had to deal with the nightmare of setting this thing up without instructions.  So I hope my supplements to the manual prove useful to you.I would highly recommend that you get this machine if you don't have space for a full size.

I honestly have no idea what some of these people are talking about!  I live in an older apartment building that can not accomodate a full sized dishwasher.  Also, being a single mom, I have precious little free time, and I don't want to waste quality time that I could be spending with my child laboring over a sink full of dishes. Enter the Haier HDT18PA.  This thing has changed my life!  It works WONDERFULLY!  I have never pulled a still-dirty dish out of it, it holds much more than you would expect it to hold (and yes...it CAN hold pots..what are these people TALKING ABOUT????).

I have owned mine for a bit shy of a year, but it is still going strong...and again I will say, we are only talking about 160 bucks...I would pay someone $160 to wash my dishes for six months...so if I get a year's worth of service out of this little beauty I will be more than happy.

A11AGOX9PSYQ96,B00005O64S,R. Robbins,"[22, 24]","Just a quick update: It's December 2008 and my dishwasher has been working great for a little over 2 and a half years.  I run it on average  four or five times a week.  No problems or service issues what so ever.***********June 4th 2006. I've had my dish washer about two months. The reviews on this little machine are certainly mixed and I really hesitated before buying it. The reviews on the similar Danby unit are better. But for the space I needed to fit it in the Haier was a better fit than the Danby; ( the Dandby is not as tall but wider). I saw that Wal-Mart had the best price and figured why not I've got 90 days to return it to any of their stores if it doesn't work out. So I ordered it and used their free ""ship-to-store"" service. It arrived at the store exactly when they said it would. About a week after I ordered it I got an email to pick it up; delivery and pick up were hassle free.Some people have complained about the packaging and shipping damage; I think perhaps packaging has been improved since some earlier reviews. My dishwasher had a plain cardboard box then a tight layer of bubble pack then the inside retail box. It was very securely packaged. As stated in other reviews setup instructions are lacking, but honestly setup is very simple and took me all of 10 minutes. Once you have have everything out of the package. Unscrew the end piece from the tip of your faucet; screw on half the quick release adapter then screw the other half of the quick release adapter onto the garden hose like fitting on the dishwasher's hose. I need to two pairs of pliers to get this part tight enough as it leaked the first time I turned it on. To connect it to the sink pull the plastic ring back and push it on the sink's faucet. The drain hose just lays in the sink. I have mine sitting right next to the kitchen sink and hoses store nicely behind the dishwasher. Hooking it up to wash a load takes all of 30 seconds.It uses very little detergent; about a table spoon which goes into an open pocket in the door. Noise is on par with any lower/middle line built in dishwasher I've used. Which is to say you know it running, but it's quite enough. The beeps when it finishes are a bit loud, but are there to remind you to turn off the faucet. The little machine cleans VERY well. At least as well as any other dishwasher I've used.The vented dry option is about useless. It takes an extra 15 minutes and is supposed to pull the steam out the drain hose. The machine does not really have a true drying mode. To switch on/off vented dry push the normal or heavy cycle  wait a second then push it again before the washer starts; you have to select it before it starts washing. The vented dry light toggles on or off and this is not clear in the manual. A normal cycle takes about 25 minutes and a heavy cycle about 40 (add another 15 minutes or so for the useless vented dry. If you hang one of the little Jet Dry baskets in the machine and just open the door at the end of the cycle it drys very fast and spot free. It's been my experience if it won't clean the dishes on normal cycle it doesn't get it on heavy either; which seems to be just a longer normal cycle.  Plus by not using the vented dry I think I'll extend the life of the machine as I'm cutting 15 minutes of use off the heating element each time I wash a load.A few hints. Run your tap water until it's HOT before you hook up the hose. My hot water out of the tap is about 120F and the water temperature coming out of the machine's drain measures at about 150F. The machine does a better job at sanitizing than I ever could by hand washing. And for one or two people is about the perfect size. Do measure the space where it will go before you order. It's about 18"" wide 20"" deep and 22"" tall, so it's very unlikely to fit under any hanging cabinets. It takes up about the same foot print as my old drying rack. After you run the machine remember to pull and rinse the filter screen at the bottom front; that will keep any funky smells out. If you don't have a vegetable spay on your sink to relieve the line pressure on the faucet & hose wrap a dish cloth around the quick disconnect before you remove it to avoid splatter.I REALLY love this little machine; for what I needed it's just about perfect. The quality seems very good it cleans well.  Uses about 4.5gal of water per wash.  It's easy to use and I figure it saves me about an hour a week from washing dishes or about 50 hours a year... how much is 50 hours of your time worth? ...

All parts were included.In my case with this product, the third time was a charm. First run-thru the machine did not drain. It gave off warning beeps as described in the manual. The problem with that is that Haier writes its manuals as if it were really a last minute detail on a Friday afternoon that they would all rather skip to go get hammered at the local bar. Or whatever the equivalent in China. I also own their clothes washer that uses the same faucet adapter and works great for me despite Haier's lack of consumer friendliness.The manual tells you that you will hear beeps if the dishwasher cycle is interrupted. What they never bother to tell you is how to resolve the problem and resume operation. Fortunately, I read the many reviews on Amazon and went back to a review that said that tipping the dishwasher allowed it to drain and reset. Thanks reviewer!Another drawback is that you cannot start a cycle anywhere but from the beginning. So I restarted that load at square one. I have to say in this machine's defense that I threw more than I would ever dared a regular dishwasher at it to see what it could do! Dinner plates with dried on spaghetti sauce and ketchup. No prewashing. Yeah, it ran twice but the dishes were clean the first time. Doesn't use a lot of water and that's good.

ATJQNC9CPQZXX,B00005O64S,Samuel Laturi,"[43, 46]","I have had this unit for 2 years and it's still going strong.  Why am I writing after all this time?  Because I am so impressed with this unit that I am considering other products by the same company.  I noticed it was still for sale and thought I would see what others' experiences were.  I have to say from reading the other reviews, that there are many misconceptions about this unit.For one person, maybe two, it rocks.  It's not a family machine.  It's a nice, compact system that takes up couple square feet of counter space.  You can put about 4 plates, 4 glasses, and couple  bowls, and silverware in a single load; and that's it!  If you over load it, there just isn't enough water flow and the dishes don't get clean.  And use liquid detergent with some kind of spot free rinse.  And run the water to get it hot before hooking up the washer and starting the cycle.  It makes a difference.Installation was a breeze with a little common sence.  You have to hook it up to your sink and that means you have to take the ring off the end of your faucet and replace it with the coupler provided.  Almost all faucets have a screw on end unless they are very designer.  Check your faucet before buying, but chances are very good you'll have this.Maybe I got lucky, but my machine did come with an instuction manual that was good as far as manuals go.After two years, have I had any problems with the unit?  Yes, actually, neither were due to a defect in the machine.  For a while nothing was coming out clean.  I tracked it down to a piece of carrot stuck in the spout on the end of the bottom wash arm.  This prevented the water from coming out of the spout at pressure thus turning the arm.  I popped it out with a toothpick and the problem was solved.Another problem once was that the water was not emptying from the unit.  I tracked that down to a faulty release valve.  Tipping the unit 45 degrees forward to reset the valve did the trick.Finally, once every so often it seems to forget what part of the cycle it is in.  Right in the middle, it will stop, beep at you as if done and then turn off.  In those cases I open the unit, find the dishes either not clean or water still in the tub and just restart it.  It goes theough another full cycle and is fine after that.  Quirky, but not a big deal.Bottom line, as with all machines, don't get mad at it, just think about the problem and see why the malfunction is happening.  Once you know why something is wrong, you can fix it.This machine has been a steal for me at the $150 I spent on it when I consider the number of dishes I didn't have to wash by hand.So, get it, use it right, and enjoy being a single guy or gal not having to do dishes on a Friday night.",5,It's exactly what I was looking for.,1113436800,"04 14, 2005"

A few pointers- You need to unscrew your sink, I didnt think that mine did.. but it did!  Make sure the machine is higher than your sink in order for it to drain properly. While this machine says compact.. it is quite large. I had to buy a separate cart to hold it. Also... this may sound crazy- but you need to have the water running. While this is common sense for some... it was not written ANYWHERE in the manual- and the customer service people were unable to tell me about this.

Water was coming out from under the door like a water fall. It's an expensive product that's cheaply made.

It's too tall to fit under most standard-size apartment cabinets and too wide to sit on standard counter comfortably.3. Weak drainage pump. Machine wouldn't drain if it's even 1 inch below counter-top level, which means you can't use a crate or separate table to place this thing on unless it's exactly as high as your kitchen counter. It also has a very short power cord, so your options for placing it are very limited.4. Dishes are NEVER dry when the wash cycle is over.5. Instructions are USELESS. I was lucky that I have an older faucet system and so attaching the water hose to it wasn't too difficult, but the machine won't hook up to newer faucents and may require additional parts that aren't included in the attachment kit.6.

Having an old house without room or the proper electrical for a full size dishwasher, I thought we'd give it a try.  Hand washing just doesn't get the dishes that nice, hot, sterile clean, so this is a great alternative.My machine arrived with some dings and dents, but the hassle of returning it outweighed the damage.  Like many others, I had to replace the washer in the hose (it all depends on the kind of faucet you have) before having a nice leak-free connection, but it's since impressed me with its performance.  My set up is a bit different in that it is permanently connected to the hot water hose of my washing machine (with a shut off valve) and drains into my washer.  In terms of washing, I give this machine high marks.  It runs in our household at least once a day, giving us super clean dishes and it swallows more than you would expect.It's the quality/fit/finish that I have issue with.  The dish rack doesn't stay on tracks in either direction(thought swapping it around might solve the problem, but no).  Even though I've tried to be very gentle with loading, one of the racks upright pegs had it's rubberized coating torn and that piece rusted off within a week.It doesn't seem that it will be a long-lived appliance, but I can appreciate it for what it is.  It's a great alternative to hand washing and when you consider the price at Amazon includes shipping......it's worth a try!****UPDATE****Have had the machine over a year.  There are going to be more pieces rusting off the internal rack, but it's still going strong.  It runs a minimum of once a day and I am still pleased with the purchase - with acceptance of its limitations.  Still beats hand washing!!!

It was ready to use right out of the box. We love it. We live in a smallish NYC apartment and this fits our lifestyle and our kitchen perfectly. We didn't purchase it via amazon, we got it at BJs on sale for about $150. It was an impulse buy and an excellent one. The interior is a bit small, it doesn't quite fit the four servings it says it does. Probably about 2-3 with several dishes, glasses, cups, sets of silverware, etc. And forget about pots and pans. But that's ok, it gets our dishes etc. sparkling clean. Never residue or spots. One of the best purchases we have made.I'm not sure why others had trouble setting it up. It was extremely easy and quick for us. Perhaps we just had the right kind of faucet? I really don't know.Important - leave the water on throughout the dry cycle, not only during the wash. My hubby taught me this. The dishwasher uses steam from the water to dry the dishes. They are not perfectly dry but mostly. We then open the door about 1"" for about an hour to let the air complete the dry. Then we put the dishes away and load it up again, if needed. And shut the water off as soon as the cycle is done (it beeps). You don't want your faucet running if it doesn't have to. Also, be sure to rinse the inner filter regularly. It catches all the goo nicely, so just pull it out, rinse it under the faucet, and put it back in.We've had it for almost six months and have used it two to three times daily. It still works like new. Quality product. We are very pleased.OOPS edited to add - WARNING! Be careful if you have limited power supply. We CANNOT run our washing machine and dryer while using this dishwasher. Running all three at once blows out all the electricity in the apartment. I guess this baby uses a lot of power. So be careful of that in your home, know the limits of your electricity.",5,Complicated set up? Not for us ...,1202515200,"02 9, 2008"

Each time, it took me 2 hours to get my phone answered, yet they refused to give me any information how long it would take to repair my dishwasher, and they refused to give me a new one either. Of course, no refund either.I called more than 20 times and at last, they told me they need to get some part from China, and they did not know how long it will take.

The filter fit into the humidifier without any issue.We have been using the filter (running the humidifier) every night for about two weeks.  The filter wicks up the water as it is supposed to do, so that the moisture is dispersed into the air.  As is usually the case when a new filter is installed, the humidifier is using the water in the tank at its optimal level, so that we refill the tank daily.  When filters get old and dried up, they don't wick up as much water.  This is one good indicator of when the filter needs to be replaced.As is the case with all filters for cool mist, impeller humidifiers, I expect this filter to collect enough minerals and dry out over time that it will need replaced.

I made sure I was ordering from Amazon.com and not another seller; perhaps that explains the comments of other reviewers on getting generic filters. I consider it likely that Holmes does not make the filters but rather licenses its name to other manufacturers.My major complaint with these filters (and the humidifier) is that it requires 20 minutes of maintenance per week, and an extra 20 minutes per month on top of that. If you don't do the maintenance, the filter lasts &#60;2 weeks before molding, as opposed to the mfr's specified 6 weeks.I cheat on the maintenance by putting a little bleach into the water 1x/week (about 1 mL bleach per tank) and running it until I can smell the bleach. Then I change the water. This procedure disinfects the machine and filter. The downside to this procedure is that bleach is corrosive, and will probably kill the motor eventually.

The new filters are about 1/2 as thick and work about 1/2 as good in humidifying the air. I called to manufacturer and they told me:&#34;We have many Honeywell units that use the HAC-504AW filter, and unfortunately, due to the filter thickness we had several units that were having a lot of trouble fitting the wet filter. There were many accounts where the filter would cause the tank or housing not to sit correctly, where it would get caught on an internal humidifier part, or where it would absorb more water than the fan could take off of it efficiently&#34;.I say to that, I don't care. Give me the thick filter and I'll deal with the rest. Too bad this option does not exist.  Actually I think this is just BS.  Probably they found a way to cut costs, and they figured no one would notice or care.So the new thinner filter in fact does work, so it's not a complete loss. On the low setting, you can refill the water once a day.HUGE TIP HERE: Don't keep buying filters to replace dirty ones.  First gently rinse them with warm soapy water. Next let it soak in a small bucket with warm water and a little bleach. Now rinse and replace.  You may smell a touch of bleach for a day or so, but it will go away.",3,It's thin like others have noted,1396656000,"04 5, 2014"

I used distilled water at first, but figured out that our soft water works just as well, preventing mineral buildup, plus it still has the chlorine that comes in tap water to ensure that it is pretty much bacteria free when refilled.  This filter element is also available at Walmart stores for a little over six bucks, and they sell the bacteria stat solution for a little over three bucks should you desire to use that. I have ignored the meter on the humidifier because it shows that the filter needs replacing after installing a new filter.  The filter changes colors when it needs to be replaced.  Using soft water and bacteria stat solution will extend the life of the filter. Mine lasted most of the winter.",4,Does the Job Well,1395360000,"03 21, 2014"

I did call sears who did send a maintance man who plugged it in and quickly unplugged it. "" This compressor is shot. it is broken"" he then searched to see if they could get the part. on his computer it stated (because he showed me) no parts..no repair..(so buyer beware).I now have 16 phone numbers to contacts that dont know what to do or dont care. Infact called one place in flordia they told me that they stopped making that model and havent seen one since 2005. So what now, this is 2012.

You get the fridge, tap, a NA sankey coupler and a line cleaning kit.The fridge gets as cold as you want and regulates the temperature well.  I have been serving quality german beer out of this thing (Warsteiner) and everyone loves it.  You cannot get more pimp for this little money, when I have people over they are blown away.  OK I am a guy and the people that come by are some of the guys but you know!  That being said this is not industrial grade bar hardware but then again you are not paying those prices.  This easily holds 1/2 barrel kegs (AKA full kegs because they are the what bars use etc)  and if you get different couplers, you can get exotic beers and run them.  The instructions say that if you do not want the NA sankey adaptor (The one for nearly every beer in the US) you can send it in and they will give you the one of your choice.  Nice!Stuff that you should get as accessories:Now the secret to non foamy beer is proper temperature and pressure and as this unit comes you get neither of these measured.  I recommend getting a low pressure gauge for the regulator (it comes only with the high pressure that measures your co2 tank and the low pressure one is key to knowing what pressure the keg is at.) and a thermometer inside.  If you go to kegworks they sell all of this plus a good grate to catch spillover.Your first beer of the day is going to have a bit of foam and this is necessary and expected.  Even at bars they run the lines first in the day.  Unless you have an expensive glycol line cooler you will never get no foam on first pour.  Also the tap warms up after non use so that foams it a bit too.  If you just put the first glass down for a min, it settles. At first I used to dump the foam but surprisingly foam turns into a lot of beer if you let it settle.I bought this unit for 599 which is good and this is far superior to the danby unit.

First let me say that it dispenses draft beer, so it'll pay for itself in about 6 kegs.But here are my complaints with it:  1.  The door doesn't close perfectly, there's never a tight seal even after trying to clean the gaskets.  Which may lead to 2. It doesn't get cold enough.  I like my beer somewhat warm, so i't not a huge deal for me, but not everyone does and this can't get cold without leading to problem 3.  The inside-back of the fridge FREEZES up.  Without a keg in it (or I use soda kegs sometimes) the ice block gets so big there's no way to get a full-size keg in.  If you leave a keg in there long enough, the ice will actually form over the keg so you need to break it off to remove keg.  It's a pain.So why did I give it 4 stars?

While it looks nice, it took some tweaking to get the performance I would expect from a unit that costs this much.The good: Looks nice.  It is a little classier than my old fridge and although it lives in the garage, it wouldn't look out of place inside.  It also comes with pretty much everything you need to hook up a keg and go, so if you want plug and play this will fit the bill.  It has proved reliable and I haven't had any problems with it.The bad: Foam.  Lots of foam on first pours.  During the summers it gets pretty hot here and the tower on this is barely insulated.  Popping the cap off while the unit was on and  taking the temperature revealed that the beer in the tower was very warm, almost room temperature.  During my quest to get rid of the foaming issue, I ended up replacing the coupler with a stainless one, the faucet with a Perlick, lengthened the beer line, and finally installed a tower cooler.Overall, if I would have done more research I probably would have bought a new chest freezer and converted that into a kegerator.  That would have allowed me to build it right from the start, and not replace substandard components one by one.

I bought my first one because I lived in a house with a HEAVY chain smoker.  Even though rated for only a single small room, that little sucker grabbed enormous amounts of smoke and the white paper on the filter blackened within weeks from particulate cancer-causing material which it saved me from inhaling.  The next two filter machines I bought for a house which was infested with black mold.  The one closest to the worst mold area blackened very quickly, while the second one, further from the mold, only grayed somewhat in the same time period -- the filter was very obviously cleaning potentially deadly black mold spores from the air.The model I have now uses the HAPF30 replacement, and it is doing ""light duty"" compared to the first three I owned.  I would have given this five stars except that I have the very distinct impression that this particular filter replacement is less efficient than the earlier ones I owned -- the filter has grayed with use, but I don't have the impression that the color change has been due entirely to grabbing airborne pollutants; I suspect (but don't have any evidence) that the filter is catching carbon which is being blown forward by the fan or else is catching dust which the negative ions generated by the machine itself have caused to fall.Despite my suspicion that this is less efficient than earlier models, I still rate it four stars because I know that it is filtering SOMETHING out of the air, and I trust the Holmes brand -- they have earned my confidence through many years of arduous work.  (I've never experienced any mechanical problems with one, either, until long, long after the warranty has expired.  These things are real workhorses.)

First, and it is unsubstantiated I admit, it does not appear to be made by Honeywell as it is shipped with no label in a plain box. I could be wrong though. Regardless, even if it were made by NASA for the space shuttle, the fact remains that it is lousy!I live in Arizona and use the humidifier for a small apartment. Within two hours of use (on high or medium setting) the top half of the filter that is not immersed in water is totally dry. Apparently the ""wicking"" action of the filter is so poor that the very act of using it (by passing air through it to humidify air) drys the filter out such that it becomes nearly useless.The OEM filter with the blue wrapping worked HUGELY better. Same apartment, same machine, same season, same outside relative humidity. With the ""blue"" filter, humidity averaged 40% . With this one, we can barely keep it at 25% and this is flipping it and rinsing it every two or three hours. The other way to compare is the tank used to empty in less than 12 hours and now is half full after 12 hours of use.I understand some people claim the blue gets mildew, but at least that is a sign that it actually stays wet!

Only after months of use & hard build-up would they lose their efffectiveness & need to be changed.  With these ""enviracaire"" filters the build up isn't heavy at all, it maybe something else (see #5 below), they just lose their effectiveness very quickly.Read more...3) I've been using humidifiers for nearly 9 years.  I have a wine cellar & walk-in humidor, and for those of you who partake in those hobbies, you know how important it is to maintain proper storage conditions.  So you might say that, yes, I do have experience in the use of humidifiers and environmental control.  4) I bought my last batch of (these) replacement filters from KAZ.  When I began using the filters & encountering problems I contacted kaz to complain.  Well, the customer service person who contacted me proceeded to tell me how it must be MY HUMIDIFIER that's not working properly as the filters work fine in hers!  RIGHT!!!!!  Does she use hers as extensively as I use mine?!  I've been using the current humidifier(s) for three years with no prior problems to this!!!MORE . . .5) Now here's the worse part, IMO.  WHAT'S WITH THE FILMY/MOLDY STUFF THAT BUILDS UP?!  When I began using these ""enviracaire"" filters, I began seeing a filmy, moldy build up in my humidifier's water system.  Even after I thoroughly clean the filter housing & install a new filter, at about the 2-4 week mark (when the filter's efficacy starts to diminidsh), the unit gets this filmy/moldy build-up in the filter housing compartment and in the water (but it doesn't get into the tank).  Whether I use a few drops of a bacteriostatic or descaling in the water tank or not doesn't make a difference.  Never seen that before, never seen it with the older filter types!!  This filmy stuff may be the reason for the decreased function of the filetr, at least that's what I suspect.So!  Should you buy this filer?You decide.

Which I don't understand why, because every electric stove knob I've ever used has to be pushed before being turned.The &#34;instructions&#34; included are basically free web translated and are useless.  Don't bother.The problem with these knobs could be simply solved by making the back of each adapter solid, so that it has a 'stop' when being put on - and they would work with both types of stoves. I don't know why the manufacturer doesn't do that.Another reviewer mentioned using epoxy in the bottoms of them to create a stop. I used a hot glue gun and did that to make them work.  Also, be aware which labels you put on - The first round, I put on the low-to-high labels without realizing they were the wrong ones. My mistake, pay attention.Since the directions are useless, I'll include my own.Directions:Remove your old knobs. Place the adapter that fits your stove 'control stem' over the stem and push it on. Place the new knob on, in the off position as well, and firmly push it in. Then you can remove the knob and the adapter will be permanently installed inside the knob.If you also have the push-then-turn type stove, and you've successfully pushed the adapter all the way in, congrats, it won't work. Remove the knob, and put hot glue/epoxy/something inside the adapter and push it down toward the bottom with something.

A2XXO4NDGULP0M,B00009V3UE,Frannie,"[3, 3]","I ordered these to replace the knobs on my 28 year old Kenmore Gas Range, made by Roper.  Buying the brand replacements would have cost over $26.00 PER KNOB!  That's far more than the range is worth.  I looked at a LOT of knob reviews for different brands online before purchasing.  Most of them claimed that the knobs in question did not fit their range or did not fit well.  Guess what, these did not fit on my range ""out of the box"" either.  HOWEVER, with ingenuity and trial and error, I found a work around.  Now the knobs are doing their job well.  All you need to do is select the plastic sleeve that fits your stem (the stem that protrudes from the range).  When I did this, and slid the knob onto the stem, it would not turn, since my knob must be pushed in, THEN turned to the left to ignite the burner.  If yours operates like this, do what I did.  I took tiny portions of a paper towel (although any similar material will do) and stuffed it into the knob shaft.  I filled about half of it and then slid it back on the stem.  Success.  The problem is that the stem is much shorter than the shaft, so the knob slides too close to the stove to be able to push it in before turning it.  Hope that description makes sense and helps someone else.  The only other problem is that the knobs feel like they could be slightly tighter on the stem.  If that continues, I plan to wrap the stem with a piece of electrical tape.Some people had trouble with the circular overlays that you peel the backing from and place on the knob.  Its only been a couple of days, but so far they are sticking.  I am sure if they come loose, a dose of contact cement will remedy that situation.  They look nice and are functioning for a small fracdtion of what the brand knobs would have cost.  I couldn't bear the thought of the knobs being worth more than the range!",4,Modifications necessary for my range,1329004800,"02 12, 2012"

Since using the trap I notice humidity, but there to water sheeting on the inside of the windows is gone.Another turn off for me is no wall attachments are included.

It is important, however, to frequently check the water level and to keep the unit clean.  Otherwise, lint may dry and build up inside.  Failure to do so can result in the lint becoming somewhat caked on the inner surface.  It is not impossible to remove, but the effort is significantly greater.  The reason I purchased a new one is because I am selling my house and a new one just looks nicer.  Also, the hose supplied in the box may not be long enough, depending upon where the unit is placed.

Pool supply companies sell ones with chlorine tablets in them and they are sturdy with a screw on lid.  Buy vent hose.  Find a metal tube that the dryer hose can fit over about 6"" long.  Use tin snips and cut 6 slits 3"" long.  Bend the slits out so now the tube is 3"" tall.  Cut a hole in the center of the bucket lid.  Insert this metal thing through the hole and seal it with Gorilla Glue.  Trust me on the glue.  Then drill a BUNCH of 1/2"" holes around the lid edge.  15 should do.

So this time around I got some vent filters and double rubber banded 1 to each side of the hose. They really do keep the lint down to a tiny fraction (and they can be washed and reused). Using this system I have had very good luck (dryer works just fine and dries quite quickly). I do keep water in the bottom - that also helps. We have not encountered the problem some people have mentioned with moisture on the walls.  Our laundry room is in the middle of the house with no windows - but there is a AC vent - so that might be why.",4,It does what it should do.,1375660800,"08 5, 2013"

A1QJGJQRQPDFT1,B00009W3HD,H. S. Marsh,"[0, 0]","If you have the misfortune to have a laundry without an outdoor vent for the dryer, you'll need something like this to catch the lint before it sprays into your apartment.  We have a condo unit in a high-rise building, and the laundry is in a small &#34;closet&#34; in the center of the unit, so we need this type of lint trap.There are two problems.  One is that the design of the trap doesn't hold the internal deflector very well.  It's a small piece of plastic that deflects the air so it flows across the water in the trap, and you have to be very careful to position it on the too-small protrusions in the wall that hold it up.  If you're careful, it works OK and doesn't fall down.The other problem is that it doesn't catch all the lint.  We were advised by someone else in the building to put cheesecloth over the deflector's vents so the lint can be caught before getting into the room.  That works, but you need to replace the cheesecloth after two or three cycles of the dryer.  Otherwise it will become clogged with lint and will impede the drying.",3,Good enough if you need it,1403481600,"06 23, 2014"

I do have a 4' washer/dryer closet and I close the doors (unventilated) during warmer months to keep the heat from getting out.  However, I only clean the trap kit about once a month and usually just add water when I see the level is getting low in between loads.  Sometimes I forget to add water, but the worst that's happened is that I found random pieces of lint stuck to my W/D closet walls!  No mold, no mildew, and I have bad allergies so I would have definitely ""felt"" the effect of any such problems long ago.I recently removed the aluminum tubing for the first time since I bought it to do a deep cleaning.  I found very minor traces of lint that my handvac sucked up in a jiffy.  Unless you have a really large dryer and do massive loads of really damp clothes pretty regularly, I don't think the warnings are any reason to not try this.  This little gadget is a wonderful solution for apartment dwellers with limited options. My only gripe is that I wish the construction was a little more solid.

This little device does a fantastic job of both.  Note that this will only work with an electric dryer.  Also this works best with houses that use heat pumps for heat instead of natural gas or other fossil fuels. During the winter, using the heat pump all the time tends to dry out the air excessively. I got some extra extension hose and pumped the hot air and moisture into my main living room.  Using this I was able to get my humidity level to a more acceptable level (40%-50%) as opposed to being in the 30% range.  This saved energy by not having to run a humidifier.  Also, this raised the temperature in my living room several degrees when the dryer was going and my heat pump did not run during this time.  For best results, I would use hot water to fill up to the line and have the discharge of hot air/moisture go into a large room.  For a small room the humidity may be too much.  This does an excellent job for collecting all the lint that comes out.",5,Very Simplistic but does a great job!,1332633600,"03 25, 2012"

I think this is for long-term use only if you are desperate and can't do anything else.  It is better than just leaving the back pipe open and pumping moist air and lint all over the room.  But not hugely better than that.  You have to monitor the water level and periodically empty out the lint from it, which is a hassle given that the thing has to sit right next to the dryer, in the back, on the floor because the vent pipe is too short to reach anywhere else.

These do collect lint but they do nothing about the hot moist air as the other two by-products of the drying process. It gets pretty cold here during the desert winters and that warm air was always appreciated... until we saw the damage. Our windows would fog over, especially upstairs as the air drifted up, and when it cooled there was water that ran down onto the sills. That water, as well as the moisture on the walls, led to some mold and drywall damage that was difficult to repair. Some sills began to rot and had to be replaced. No, we don't do a lot of drying for the two of us but the cumulative effects don't take too long to manifest themselves. If you don't clean the lint trap regularly it quickly develops into a rotten smelling black bilge like substance that is very hard to clean... and did I say it reeks if you let it go a week or two. We have an electric dryer so fumes were never an issue. I just did the deed and drilled some 4"" holes, ducted the dryer down to the crawlspace and then out to the great outdoors. Having that trap sitting on the floor next to the dryer also caused my floor tiles to loosen as the heat slowly broke down the glue that held the tiles in place. I wish I had ducted the dryer the day I bought it. If, on the other hand, you have no choice then go for it but be forewarned that it can cause physical damage and perhaps even health issues because there's no way this little box can handle all the lint that passes through, and over, it.

Anyone who has dealt with electronics knows how simple a power supply cord is. Therefore, a review for one is a little strange to write.Overall, it appears identical to the one that was originally on her dryer, from the factory. It appears to be very well-made and, more importantly, is 10 feet long. Locally, I could only find some that were up to 6 feet, and they were too short for her need.Since it was so much like the original, I could find nothing wrong with it and it contained everything I needed to connect it to the dryer. Additionally, it does give me enough play so that if I have to replace an end, I have the room.The price was also outstanding given that the six-foot version was about five dollars more than this one, locally. Shipping was excellent and it arrived on time.I would recommend this to anyone who needs a dryer cord of this size.

You need to buy one separate from your dryer, and if you don't, you won't be able to plug in your dryer (I didn't see that coming).  A 6' cord should be long enough (the longer ones are more appealing to the price-conscious, but unless you need it, the extra length just wastes electricity).  There are 3-prong and four-prong plugs but most take the 3-prong (look closely at your outlet.  At first glance, some of the outlets look like they have 4 holes when they really only have 3).  Lots of people already know this, and lots of people flat don't believe it till they get their dryer and can't plug it in.  I was in the latter group.

A21CZBUSK8VCD2,B00009W3PA,"Jeffrey Taylor ""Jtaylor""","[0, 1]","We had just moved from a house into an older apartment complex that had washer/dryer hook-up and I thought that the dryer cord would be able to make the outlet. It wasn't till everything was signed and we moved everything in that I discovered the cord wasn't going to reach. I needed about 4 more inches and that was going to be pushing it. How the laundry hook-ups were, the only thing that would accommodate would be a stackable washer/dryer, which I don't have. I, like most other reviewees, searched everywhere but no store carried a cord longer than 6ft. I had already had to change out the cord that came with the dryer from a 4-prong to a 3-prong when I moved into the house so I was a little frustrated that I would have to buy yet a 3rd cord. I placed an order before Christmas, but est delivery was for the 10th of January. I cancelled the order in hopes of finding another way since it was going on 2 weeks before I had a chance to any laundry. I stacked the dryer on a couple totes next to the washer for the time being. It was still a hassle but at least I was getting clothes done. I re-ordered the cord and received it today and it is awesome. It's just a cord but something like this needs to be supplied in retail stores. The prices that I researched on all dryer cords seem like they wouldn't be too different from online stores, after shipping and tax. But overall, my wife and I are happy with the result of not having to struggle to clean clothes now. Go ahead and get this product if you need a longer cord.",5,Just What We Needed,1264032000,"01 21, 2010"

The product is excellent and very durable. My suggestion, because there are no instructions included,  and nothing should ever be assumed when working with electricity (by the way make sure you turn the circuit breaker off for the dryer power when connecting this power cord), is that the 3 wires from the power cord which connect to the screws on the back of the dryer terminal block should be color coded or labeled as to which one is the neutral wire, and which are the 2 hot wires. In reality they have made it so easy by making the center wire of this power cord as the neutral wire  (corresponding with the neutral white internal dryer wire connected already on the other side of the terminal block). So the center wire of the power cord  is connected to the middle/center screw on the dryer terminal block.

It was a little bit of an impulse buy, so when I got a chance I jumped online to read some reviews. I was seriously concerned about the negative reviews here and at other sites, which were mainly concerning lack of service from the authorized service centers, but which also seemed to show a pattern where the kegerator would not keep the beer cold enough.I promised myself that if I was happy with the product after a reasonable amount of time, I would post a review, just to balance things out.I personally don't keep the beer below 34 degrees. Depending on what point in the cooling cycle the kegerator is, my beer is usually between 34 and 38 degrees. This is plenty cold enough for me - but then again, I don't need a nipple for my beer mug. 8-) I have been happy with the cooling ability of the unit.I'm still concerned that if I have any service issues, there may be a problem, fortunately I purchased the 3 year warranty offered by Best Buy for $24.95.

I've tried more that once and stayed within guide lines. Don't ever trust Walmart's Customer reviews they are biased.My Keggerator stopped working 4 1/2 months after I purchased it. It was extremely loud and often heard it running at night. I had many a sleepless night listening to the machine run. The temperature regulation on it is a small dial on the back with no gauge. I had to buy a separate thermometer to figure out the temperature because the temperature of my beer would fluctuate greatly. Perhaps this is why it broke.After it broke I called Haier 7 times before they would help me. On the 7th time I told them I was not going to call them anymore but instead call the Better Business Bureau. Every Time I called them they told me that they could not find any repair man in my zip code and a support manager would contact me with in 24 to 72 hrs. . Every time I called them I would get someone speaking in broken English and I finally asked them what country they where in which was the Philippines. They told me they are a contracted customer support for Haier. When I asked to talk to someone from the company they said I couldn't do that but I would be contacted with in 24 to 72hrs. Hmmmm. I smell something Fishy. Then I went back to the Haier web site and looked for any address or phone number that was not a 1 800 number. No luck. Look your self. I e-mailed them twice and they replied with please call our customer support number. After the 7th phone call they did call me back. I still have a broken product.

No problems with the temperature adjustment (but then, I'm not trying to keep my beer at 34 degrees), it pours nicely, the components seem to be high quality - aside from the plastic hose clamps for the CO2 line, but those were easy to replace with metal ones at the hardware store.However, I have to agree with the other reviewers, Haier's customer service is...challenging. My wife bought me the dispenser for Christmas (that's true love). She had it delivered to a neighbor's house so I wouldn't suspect anything. On December 26, I went to retrieve the box and set it up in my basement. Upon opening the unit, I discovered that a significant number of parts were missing - LIKE THE ENTIRE CO2 SYSTEM, TAP, AND KEG CONNECTION. Basically I had a $600 mini-fridge. You'd think someone in shipping might notice that the box was 25 pound light, but, whatever.I called Haier, and they were fairly helpful at first. They told me I should fax a list of the missing parts along with my proof of purchase, which I did. They then told me it would be a couple days to ""validate"" my claim, a couple days to process the order, and then two weeks for the parts to arrive. I called back every few days to see how things were going, and it was easy to get a real person on the phone each time, but these people weren't able to offer much information.Apparently, Haier's parts warehouse is located on the dark side of the moon, because it was impossible for customer service to tell me when or how the parts would be shipping. No way to get a tracking number, no way to know if the parts were in stock, nothing. So, I waited patiently for three weeks. When the parts didn't show up, I called back and, surprise, they couldn't tell me what happened. I talked to a supervisor at Haier, and she told me the same thing. She started to resubmit the order, but several parts were now showing up as backordered on her screen, with no ETA available.At this point, I was done with Haier. I called Amazon and explained my situation, and I said I wanted to get an exchange or a refund. At first, I was told to ""contact the manufacturer."" When I explained that I'd been doing that for the past month with no luck, they agreed to exchange it, no problem. They also said I wasn't the only one this happened to. Within two days, a replacement was on its way, and I had a tracking number.

Sure I did some research then one Saturday I was having a party and went and picked this up at the local Brandsmart.  Beer would come out cold, not as cold as I'd like but not too warm.  One thing I learned right away, you have to let the keg sit overnight before tapping inside the cooler.  I'm new to this, so I did not know the pitfalls of tapping a warm keg.  I came on here and read some of the reviews.  It was not until about a month later that the temperature issue became a problem.  I hesitated but took a previous poster's advice and now the beer is as cold as I like.  I recommenc going for a half to 3/4 turn on the screw as opposed to a full one.  You dont want the thing to run so much that it burns out.  I would find it odd how the cooler would cycle on for about 5 minutes then off for 20.  Now its on for 20-30 and off for the same.
